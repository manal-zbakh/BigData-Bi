        "Title": "Incentivizing Data Quality in Blockchain-Based Systems\u2014The Case of the Digital Cardossier",
        "Abstract": "Inspired by an industry initiative to address the celebrated market for lemons (poor-quality used cars), we investigate how incentives for a permissioned blockchain-based system in the automobile ecosystem can be designed to ensure high-quality data storage and use by different stakeholders. The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms. Furthermore, we explore incentive design in permissioned blockchains and discuss its latest implications.",

        "Title": "Connect API with Blockchain: A Survey on Blockchain Oracle Implementation",
        "Abstract": "A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications (DApps). Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the \u201coracle problem\u201d and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces (APIs) connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This paper studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants\u2019 stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state-of-the-art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.",

        "Title": "Developing Cost-Effective Blockchain-Powered Applications: A Case Study of the Gas Usage of Smart Contract Transactions in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform",
        "Abstract": "Ethereum is a blockchain platform that hosts and executes smart contracts. Executing a function of a smart contract burns a certain amount of gas units (a.k.a., gas usage). The total gas usage depends on how much computing power is necessary to carry out the execution of the function. Ethereum follows a free-market policy for deciding the transaction fee for executing a transaction. More specifically, transaction issuers choose how much they are willing to pay for each unit of gas (a.k.a., gas price). The final transaction fee corresponds to the gas price times the gas usage. Miners process transactions to gain mining rewards, which come directly from these transaction fees. The flexibility and the inherent complexity of the gas system pose challenges to the development of blockchain-powered applications. Developers of blockchain-powered applications need to translate requests received in the frontend of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Yet, it is unclear how developers should set the gas parameters of these transactions given that (i) miners are free to prioritize transactions whichever way they wish and (ii) the gas usage of a contract transaction is only known after the transaction is processed and included in a new block. In this article, we analyze the gas usage of Ethereum transactions that were processed between Oct. 2017 and Feb. 2019 (the Byzantium era). We discover that (i) most miners prioritize transactions based on their gas price only, (ii) 25% of the functions that received at least 10 transactions have an unstable gas usage (coefficient of variation = 19%), and (iii) a simple prediction model that operates on the recent gas usage of a function achieves an R-Squared of 0.76 and a median absolute percentage error of 3.3%. We conclude that (i) blockchain-powered application developers should be aware that transaction prioritization in Ethereum is frequently done based solely on the gas price of transactions (e.g., a higher transaction fee does not necessarily imply a higher transaction priority) and act accordingly and (ii) blockchain-powered application developers can leverage gas usage prediction models similar to ours to make more informed decisions to set the gas price of their transactions. Lastly, based on our findings, we list and discuss promising avenues for future research.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-enabled Federated Learning: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has experienced a boom in recent years, which is jointly promoted by the prosperity of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence along with emerging privacy issues. In the FL paradigm, a central server and local end devices maintain the same model by exchanging model updates instead of raw data, with which the privacy of data stored on end devices is not directly revealed. In this way, the privacy violation caused by the growing collection of sensitive data can be mitigated. However, the performance of FL with a central server is reaching a bottleneck, while new threats are emerging simultaneously. There are various reasons, among which the most significant ones are centralized processing, data falsification, and lack of incentives. To accelerate the proliferation of FL, blockchain-enabled FL has attracted substantial attention from both academia and industry. A considerable number of novel solutions are devised to meet the emerging demands of diverse scenarios. Blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of FL from various perspectives. In this survey, we will comprehensively summarize and evaluate existing variants of blockchain-enabled FL, identify the emerging challenges, and propose potentially promising research directions in this under-explored domain.",

        "Abstract": "Human genomic data carry unique information about an individual and offer unprecedented opportunities for healthcare. The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, poses major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide a secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this article, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.",

        "Title": "Data Privacy Based on IoT Device Behavior Control Using Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to improve the individuals\u2019 quality of life. However, ensuring security and privacy in the IoT context is a non-trivial task due to the low capability of these connected devices. Generally, the IoT device management is based on a centralized entity that validates communication and connection rights. Therefore, this centralized entity can be considered as a single point of failure. Yet, in the case of distributed approaches, it is difficult to delegate the right validation to IoT devices themselves in untrustworthy IoT environments. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide decentralization of overcoming the trust problem while designing a privacy-preserving system. To this end, we propose a novel privacy-preserving IoT device management framework based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed system, the IoT devices are controlled by several smart contracts that validate the connection rights according to the privacy permission settings predefined by the data owners and the stored record array of detected misbehavior of each IoT device. In fact, smart contracts can immediately detect the devices that have vulnerabilities and have been hacked or pose a threat to the IoT network. Therefore, the data owner\u2019s privacy is preserved by enforcing the control over the own devices. For validation purposes, we deploy the proposed solution on a private Ethereum blockchain and give the performance evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.",

        "Title": "Concurrent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance for Integration of Blockchain and Supply Chain",
        "Abstract": "Currently, the integration of the supply chain and blockchain is promising, as blockchain successfully eliminates the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. Generally, concurrent Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus method, named C-PBFT, is powerful to deal with the consensus inefficiencies, caused by the fast node expansion in the supply chain. However, due to the tremendous complicated transactions in the supply chain, it remains challenging to select the credible primary peers in the concurrent clusters. To address this challenge, the peers in the supply chain are classified into several clusters by analyzing the historic transactions in the ledger. Then, the primary peer for each cluster is identified by reputation assessment. Finally, the performance of C-PBFT is evaluated by conducting experiments in Fabric.",

        "Abstract": "Decentralized control, low-complexity, flexible and efficient communications are the requirements of an architecture that aims to scale blockchains beyond the current state. Such properties are attainable by reducing ledger size and providing parallel operations in the blockchain. Sharding is one of the approaches that lower the burden of the nodes and enhance performance. However, the current solutions lack the features for resolving concurrency during cross-shard communications. With multiple participants belonging to different shards, handling concurrent operations is essential for optimal sharding. This issue becomes prominent due to the lack of architectural support and requires additional consensus for cross-shard communications. Relying on the advantages of hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS), like Ethereum, hybrid consensus and 2-hop blockchain, we propose Reinshard, a new blockchain that inherits the properties of hybrid consensus for optimal sharding. Reinshard uses PoW and PoS chain-pairs with PoS sub-chains for all the valid chain-pairs where the hybrid consensus is attained through Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). Our architecture provides a secure method of arranging nodes in shards and resolves concurrency conflicts using the delay factor of VDF. The applicability of Reinshard is demonstrated through security and experimental evaluations. A practical concurrency problem is considered to show the efficacy of Reinshard in providing optimal sharding.",

        "Title": "Enabling Short-Term Energy Flexibility Markets Through Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Climate change has put significant pressure on energy markets. Political decisions such as the plan of the German government to shut down coal power plants by 2038 are shifting electricity production towards renewable and distributed energy resources. The share of these resources will continue to grow significantly in the coming years. This trend changes the ways how energy markets work which mandates fundamental changes in the underlying IT infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution which enables an economically viable and grid-serving integration of distributed energy resources into the existing energy system. Our blockchain-based approach targets intraday and day-ahead operating reserve markets, on which energy grid operators and operators of distributed energy resources can trade flexibilities within the schedulable energy production and consumption of their resources. By utilizing these flexibilities as an operating reserve, renewable and climate-friendly technologies can contribute to maintaining the grid stability and security of supply while simultaneously creating economically interesting business models for their operators. We propose to define blockchain-based short-term energy markets by utilizing the concept of general-purpose smart contracts and cryptocurrencies. This enables direct and decentralized trading of energy flexibilities without any intermediary or central instance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an implementation of a prototype of the proposed markets based on the Ethereum blockchain and provide a detailed evaluation of its efficiency and scalability.",

        "Title": "A Study on Blockchain Architecture Design Decisions and Their Security Attacks and Threats",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE\u2019s attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.",

        "Abstract": "The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, vaccine incidents occurred around the world, which endangers people\u2019s lives. In the technical respect, these incidents are partially due to the fact that existing vaccine management systems are distributively managed by different entities in the vaccine supply chain. This architecture makes it relatively easy to modify or even delete the vaccine circulation data maliciously, which makes tracing problematic vaccine hard and identifying the responsibility for a vaccine accident hard. To solve these issues, this article presents a blockchain-based solution to protect the whole process of vaccine circulation. We first propose a model to supervise the vaccine circulation process by incorporating existing regulatory practices. Then, we propose a blockchain-based tracing system to implement this model. The proposed system takes the blockchain as a global, unique, and verifiable database to store all the circulation data. Through data insertions and queries on the global and unique database, the proposed system achieves the protection of vaccine circulation. We also implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed system. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system is beneficial.",

Hence, \u201cWhy Blockchain?\u201d is a question that many scientists and managers still ask themselves or have to answer when facing the technology's critics. While the question is undoubtedly justified, it cannot always be answered from a purely technical perspective. Thus, in this study, we apply a socio-technical IS artifact perspective and analyze the reasons managers involved in blockchain consortia have for using blockchain technology. Based on a multiple-case study of 19 blockchain consortia, including interviews with 53 stakeholders, we explicate 19 different motives that justify engagement with the technology in practice. Further, we identify the systemic character of tokenization and the importance of the socio-technical interplay of aspects like power decentralization that justify the necessity of blockchain",

As such, both concepts offer the vision of an altered relationship between public administration and its non-public actors by emphasizing a strong position of non-public actors for public service delivery. This research aims to identify the relevance of NPG to leading blockchain implementations in the European public sector. For this purpose, both topics are combined in an explorative analysis. The analysis leverages an adapted analysis framework designed for this research effort to structure the expectations around NPG. Qualitative interviews with multiple key stakeholders of blockchain implementations projects were conducted to understand the actual impact of blockchain on the actor's relationships for public service delivery. This article presents the findings to this question and concludes that the use of blockchain has the changed actor relationships only in parts. Consequently, the author finally draws attention to the importance of blockchain governance and blockchain regulation for further developing the relationships of public administrations and their non-public counterparts.",

        "Abstract": "This article discusses secure methods to conduct e-voting over a blockchain in three different settings: decentralized voting, centralized remote voting, and centralized polling station voting. These settings cover almost all voting scenarios that occur in practice. A proof-of-concept implementation for decentralized voting over Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is presented. This work demonstrates the suitable use of a blockchain not just as a public bulletin board but, more importantly, as a trustworthy computing platform that enforces the correct execution of the voting protocol in a publicly verifiable manner. We also discuss scaling up a blockchain-based voting application for national elections. We show that for national-scale elections the major verifiability problems can be addressed without having to depend on any blockchain. However, a blockchain remains a viable option to realize a public bulletin board, which has the advantage of being a \u201cpreventive\u201d measure to stop retrospective changes on previously published records as opposed to a \u201cdetective\u201d measure like the use of mirror websites.

        "Abstract": "Blockchain records transactions with various protection techniques against tampering. To meet the requirements on cooperation and anonymity of companies and organizations, researchers have developed a few solutions. Ring signature-based schemes allow multiple participants cooperatively to manage while preserving their individuals\u2019 privacy. However, the solutions cannot work properly due to the increased computing complexity along with the expanded group size. In this article, we propose a Multi-center Anonymous Blockchain-based (MAB) system, with joint management for the consortium and privacy protection for the participants. To achieve that, we formalize the syntax used by the MAB system and present a general construction based on a modular design. By applying cryptographic primitives to each module, we instantiate our scheme with anonymity and decentralization. Furthermore, we carry out a comprehensive formal analysis of our exemplified scheme. A proof of concept simulation is provided to show the feasibility. The results demonstrate security and efficiency from both theoretical perspectives and practical perspectives.",

        "Title": "How Can Incentive Mechanisms and Blockchain Benefit with Each Other? A Survey",
        "Abstract": "In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has been widely deployed in various fields, such as finance, education, and public services. Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.",

Due to central governance and lack of effective information aggregation mechanisms, energy trading cannot be efficiently scheduled and tracked. We devise a new distributed energy transaction system over the energy Industrial Internet of Things based on predictive analytics, blockchain, and smart contract technologies. We propose a solution for scheduling distributed energy sources based on the Minimum Cut Maximum Flow theory. Blockchain is used to record transactions and reach consensus. Payment clearing for the actual power consumption is executed via smart contracts.

        "Title": "Blockchain-Based Audio Watermarking Technique for Multimedia Copyright Protection in Distribution Networks",
        "Abstract": "Copyright protection in multimedia protection distribution is a challenging problem. To protect multimedia data, many watermarking methods have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them cannot be used effectively in a multimedia distribution network (MDN) as they are not designed to support multi-layer watermark embedding. Multi-layer watermarking mechanisms were developed to protect multimedia data across different layers in an MDN. However, in those mechanisms, we need to trust the entities in the MDN, such as regional and country distributors. To overcome this potential drawback, in this article, we propose a novel privacy protection mechanism for MDNs by combining the advantages of both blockchain and watermarking technologies. A specifically designed watermarking algorithm is used to link the copyright information with the audio file, while a novel blockchain-based smart contract mechanism is developed to enforce the proper functioning of each entity in the distribution network. Moreover, the new audio mechanism is computationally efficient. Although audio signals are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the proposed approach can easily be extended to other multimedia objects, such as an image. The validity of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by our simulation results. The proposed mechanism can benefit multimedia production companies and other entities in the MDN.",

        "Abstract": "EOSIO has become one of the most popular blockchain platforms since its mainnet launch in June 2018. In contrast to the traditional PoW-based systems (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), which are limited by low throughput, EOSIO is the first high throughput Delegated Proof of Stake system that has been widely adopted by many decentralized applications. Although EOSIO has millions of accounts and billions of transactions, little is known about its ecosystem, especially related to security and fraud. In this paper, we perform a large-scale measurement study of the EOSIO blockchain and its associated DApps. We gather a large-scale dataset of EOSIO and characterize activities including money transfers, account creation and contract invocation. Using our insights, we then develop techniques to automatically detect bots and fraudulent activity. We discover thousands of bot accounts (over 30% of the accounts in the platform) and a number of real-world attacks (301 attack accounts). By the time of our study, 80 attack accounts we identified have been confirmed by DApp teams, causing 828,824 EOS tokens losses (roughly \\$2.6 million) in total.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.",

        "Abstract": "Voting is a formal expression of opinion or choice, either positive or negative, made by an individual or a group of individuals. However, conventional voting systems tend to be centralized, which are known to suffer from security and efficiency limitations. Hence, there has been a trend of moving to decentralized voting systems, such as those based on blockchain. The latter is a decentralized digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network, where a copy of the append-only ledger of digitally signed and encrypted transactions is maintained by each participant. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of blockchain-based voting systems and classify them based on a number of features (e.g., the types of blockchain used, the consensus approaches used, and the scale of participants). By systematically analyzing and comparing the different blockchain-based voting systems, we also identify a number of limitations and research opportunities. Hopefully, this survey will provide an in-depth insight into the potential utility of blockchain in voting systems and device future research agenda.",

Our findings are threefold:<?brk?> (i) identification of security, scalability, performance, and interoperability as the commonly reported quality attributes; (ii) a catalog of twelve architectural tactics for the design of IoT systems supported by blockchain; and (iii) gaps in research that include tradeoffs among quality attributes and identified tactics.

        "Abstract": "Medical image fusion generates a fused image containing multiple features extracted from different source images, and it is of great help in clinical analysis and diagnosis. However, training a deep learning model for image fusion usually requires enormous computing power, especially for large volumes of medical data. Meanwhile, the privacy of images is also a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based medical image fusion (BMIF) framework. First, to ensure fusion performance, we design a new medical image fusion model based on convolutional neural network and Inception network, and integrate the proposed model into the consensus process of blockchain. Next, to save computing power of blockchain, we design a consensus mechanism by requesting consensus nodes to train the fusion model instead of calculating useless hash values in traditional blockchain. Then, to protect data privacy, we further present an efficient homomorphic encryption to realize the training of fusion model on encrypted medical data. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on public datasets to evaluate the feasibility and the performance of our proposed BMIF. The results exhibit that BMIF is efficient and secure, and our medical image fusion network performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Title": "Enabling IC Traceability via Blockchain Pegged to Embedded PUF",
        "Abstract": "Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.",

        "Title": "Integration of Blockchain with Connected and Autonomous Vehicles: Vision and Challenge",
        "Abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are introduced to improve individuals\u2019 quality of life by offering a wide range of services. They collect a huge amount of data and exchange them with each other and the infrastructure. The collected data usually includes sensitive information about the users and the surrounding environment. Therefore, data security and privacy are among the main challenges in this industry. Blockchain, an emerging distributed ledger, has been considered by the research community as a potential solution for enhancing data security, integrity, and transparency in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, despite the emphasis of governments on the transparency of personal data protection practices, CAV stakeholders have not been successful in communicating appropriate information with the end users regarding the procedure of collecting, storing, and processing their personal data, as well as the data ownership. This article provides a vision of the opportunities and challenges of adopting blockchain in ITS from the \u201cdata transparency\u201d and \u201cprivacy\u201d perspective. The main aim is to answer the following questions: (1) Considering the amount of personal data collected by the CAVs, such as location, how would the integration of blockchain technology affect transparency, fairness, and lawfulness of personal data processing concerning the data subjects (as this is one of the main principles in the existing data protection regulations)? (2) How can the trade-off between transparency and privacy be addressed in blockchain-based ITS use cases?",

        "Abstract": "Recent data leak scandals, together with the under-utilization of collected data (estimated that around 90% of data never leaves a device\u2019s local storage), limits the applicability and potential of novel data driven applications. Thus, novel ways to treat data, in which users are guaranteed control, usability, and privacy over their generated data are needed. In this paper we propose a novel privacy-preserving blockchain framework for a data sharing marketplace. The proposed framework allows users (such as sensors and devices) that generate data to store it in external servers, while the blockchain is utilized to record buy and sell transactions between parties, as well as perform access control by generating access sequences whenever trades are performed. A novel perspective over data ownership is presented, in which whoever generates the data has completed ownership and control over it and the blockchain transactions are only utilized to guarantee temporary access to it. The proposed blockchain framework also supports different types of data and provides, via the distributed and openness of the framework, quality, timeliness and similarity control over the data stored in the marketplace. In this context, different types of applications that can benefit from this framework are presented and open problems are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic systems are ubiquitous today, playing an irreplaceable role in our personal lives, as well as in critical infrastructures such as power grids, satellite communications, and public transportation. In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable \u201cby default\u201d without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.",

        "Abstract": "A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing is a network model of on-demand access for sharing configurable computing resource pools. Compared with conventional service architectures, cloud computing introduces new security challenges in secure service management and control, privacy protection, data integrity protection in distributed databases, data backup, and synchronization. Blockchain can be leveraged to address these challenges, partly due to the underlying characteristics such as transparency, traceability, decentralization, security, immutability, and automation. We present a comprehensive survey of how blockchain is applied to provide security services in the cloud computing model and we analyze the research trends of blockchain-related techniques in current cloud computing models. During the reviewing, we also briefly investigate how cloud computing can affect blockchain, especially about the performance improvements that cloud computing can provide for the blockchain. Our contributions include the following: (i) summarizing the possible architectures and models of the integration of blockchain and cloud computing and the roles of cloud computing in blockchain; (ii) classifying and discussing recent, relevant works based on different blockchain-based security services in the cloud computing model; (iii) simply investigating what improvements cloud computing can provide for the blockchain; (iv) introducing the current development status of the industry/major cloud providers in the direction of combining cloud and blockchain; (v) analyzing the main barriers and challenges of integrated blockchain and cloud computing systems; and (vi) providing recommendations for future research and improvement on the integration of blockchain and cloud systems.",

We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.",

        "Abstract": "The rise of fast communication media both at the core and at the edge has resulted in unprecedented numbers of sophisticated and intelligent wireless IoT devices. Tactile Internet has enabled the interaction between humans and machines within their environment to achieve revolutionized solutions both on the move and in real-time. Many applications such as intelligent autonomous self-driving, smart agriculture and industrial solutions, and self-learning multimedia content filtering and sharing have become attainable through cooperative, distributed, and decentralized systems, namely, volunteer computing. This article introduces a blockchain-enabled resource sharing and service composition solution through volunteer computing. Device resource, computing, and intelligence capabilities are advertised in the environment to be made discoverable and available for sharing with the aid of blockchain technology. Incentives in the form of on-demand service availability are given to resource and service providers to ensure fair and balanced cooperative resource usage. Blockchains are formed whenever a service request is initiated with the aid of fog and mobile edge computing (MEC) devices to ensure secure communication and service delivery for the participants. Using both volunteer computing techniques and tactile internet architectures, we devise a fast and reliable service provisioning framework that relies on a reinforcement learning technique. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can achieve high reward distribution, increased number of blockchain formations, reduced delays, and balanced resource usage among participants, under the premise of high IoT device availability.",

        "Abstract": "Although the iterative double auction has been widely used in many different applications, one of the major problems in its current implementations is that they rely on a trusted third party to handle the auction process. This imposes the risk of single point of failures, monopoly, and bribery. In this article, we aim to tackle this problem by proposing a novel decentralized and trustless framework for iterative double auction based on blockchain. Our design adopts the smart contract and state channel technologies to enable a double auction process among parties that do not need to trust each other, while minimizing the blockchain transactions. In specific, we propose an extension to the original concept of state channels that can support multiparty computation. Then, we provide a formal development of the proposed framework and prove the security of our design against adversaries. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation of our framework using Elixir and Solidity, on which we conduct various experiments to demonstrate its feasibility and practicality.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity in the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this paper proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called L2DART (Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.",

The design of password hashing schemes (PHSs) is in the core of blockchain security.

        "Title": "Facilitating Serverless Match-based Online Games with Novel Blockchain Technologies",
        "Abstract": "Applying peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to online video games has already attracted both academic and industrial interests, since it removes the need for expensive server maintenance. However, there are two major issues preventing the use of a P2P architecture, namely how to provide an effective distributed data storage solution, and how to tackle potential cheating behaviors. Inspired by emerging blockchain techniques, we propose a novel consensus model called Proof-of-Play (PoP) to provide a decentralized data storage system that incorporates an anti-cheating mechanism for P2P games, by rewarding players that interact with the game as intended, along with consideration of security measures to address the Nothing-at-stake Problem and the Long-range Attack. To validate our design, we utilize a game-theory model to show that under certain assumptions, the integrity of the PoP system would not be undermined due to the best interests of any user. Then, as a proof-of-concept, we developed a P2P game (Infinity Battle) to demonstrate how a game can be integrated with PoP in practice. Finally, experiments were conducted to study PoP in comparison with Proof-of-Work (PoW) to show its advantages in various aspects.",

        "Abstract": "Security and privacy of users have become significant concerns due to the involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in numerous applications. Cyber threats are growing at an explosive pace making the existing security and privacy measures inadequate. Hence, everyone on the Internet is a product for hackers. Consequently, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used to produce accurate outputs from large complex databases, where the generated outputs can be used to predict and detect vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems. Furthermore, Blockchain (BC) techniques are becoming popular in modern IoT applications to solve security and privacy issues. Several studies have been conducted on either ML algorithms or BC techniques. However, these studies target either security or privacy issues using ML algorithms or BC techniques, thus posing a need for a combined survey on efforts made in recent years addressing both security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques. In this article, we provide a summary of research efforts made in the past few years, from 2008 to 2019, addressing security and privacy issues using ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. First, we discuss and categorize various security and privacy threats reported in the past 12 years in the IoT domain. We then classify the literature on security and privacy efforts based on ML algorithms and BC techniques in the IoT domain. Finally, we identify and illuminate several challenges and future research directions using ML algorithms and BC techniques to address security and privacy issues in the IoT domain.",

        "Title": "Privacy-Preserving Reputation Systems Based on Blockchain and Other Cryptographic Building Blocks: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem connects physical devices to the internet, offering significant advantages in agility, responsiveness and potential environmental benefits. The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralised storage and computing to operate the deep learning algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models\u2019 vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilisation of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems. It also focuses on IoT data analytics from a security perspective and the open research questions. It also provides a thorough literature review of blockchain-based FL approaches for IoT applications. Finally, the challenges and risks associated with integrating blockchain and FL in IoT are discussed to be considered in future works.",

        "Abstract": "Limitations on high latency and low scalability of classical blockchain systems retard their adoptions and applications. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems. We abstract a general model to capture the main features and identify six types of design patterns. Then, we evaluate these systems from the perspectives of structure, consensus, property, security, and performance. We further discuss the trade-off between different factors, open challenges, and the potentiality of DAG-based solutions, indicating their promising directions for future research.",

Therefore, to improve the security of private information in medical systems, this article uses blockchain technology to design a method to protect private information in medical systems and effectively realize anti-theft control of private information. First, the Patient-oriented Privacy Preserving Access Control model is introduced into the access control process of private information in medical systems. Next, a private information storage platform is built by using blockchain technology, and information transmission is realized using standard cryptographic algorithms. In this process, file authorization contracts are also used to guarantee the security of private information and further prevent theft of medical private information. Our simulation results show that the storage response time of this method is kept below 1,000 ms, and the maximum information throughput rate reaches 550 kbit/s, which indicates that this method has strong performance in information storage and transmission efficiency. Moreover, the reliability and bandwidth utilization of data transmission across domains is higher, so the method has higher information security control performance and superior overall performance.",

        "Abstract": "Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our model gains superior estimation performance.",

        "Abstract": "E-health is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for the healthcare related services. It uses various types of digital technologies and telecommunications, such as computers, sensing devices, Internet, and mobile devices to deliver medical services. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a communication environment optimized for low power devices (for example, health sensors and actuators) and operation on, in or around the human body (i.e., a patient). It can be used in various applications which are related to healthcare, such as \u201cbody automation\u201d, \u201chealthcare\u201d, \u201cmedical monitoring\u201d, \u201cbody interaction\u201d and \u201cmedical implants (i.e., pacemaker)\u201d. Most of the communications happen in IoMT based e-healthcare system are wireless in nature. This may cause severe threats to the security of the system. Various information security related attacks i.e., replay, man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM), impersonation, privileged insider, unauthorised session key computation, credentials leakage, stolen verifier, malware injection are possible in IoMT based e-healthcare system. These threats and attacks can create serious problems in the social life of an individual as this may reveal their confidential healthcare information to other unauthorised parties. Therefore, it is essential to propose an access control and key management scheme to secure the communication of a IoMT based e-healthcare system. Moreover, the security of such kind of scheme can also be enhanced through the deployment of a blockchain mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a blockchain enabled access control and key management protocol for IoMT based e-healthcare system which is named as \u201cBACKM-EHA\u201d in short. The security analysis of proposed BACKM-EHA is also provided through the standard i.e., \u201cReal-Or-Random model\u201d. The various conducted security analyses prove the security of BACKM-EHA against the different types of potential attacks. The performance of BACKM-EHA is better than the other existing schemes as it requires less communication cost, computation cost and provides more \u201csecurity and functionality features\u201d.",

        "Abstract": "In this information age, with the emergence of organizations, the number of various resources on the Internet of Things is also increasing. Generally, different users have different access permissions to different resources and most of the existing schemes have realized access control. But most of them are rough and not feasible in many organizations. Moreover, traditional access control schemes adopted a central entity or a trusted third party to centrally manage users\u2019 permissions and access information, which can easily lead to single point of failure. Therefore, a kind of secure, trusted, and fine-grained access control is urgently needed in some large-scale organizations or institutions that maintain thousands of IoT devices. In order to solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based high-efficiency access control framework called BHE-AC to achieve secure and efficient access to resources for users. In BHE-AC, a registration model is designed to register users and resources, and it can evaluate the ability value for users according to their attributes which is an essential factor when requesting resources. Besides, we represent a blockchain-based token requesting mechanism to compare the capability values of users with requested resources; meanwhile, the mechanism also allows users to request multiple resources at the same time, which can avoid repeated requests. Then, an unforgeable token indicates the users\u2019 access to a specific resource is granted to a requester only if a requester meets the access requirements; from then on, the user can use a token to invoke the resource. Finally, security analysis and experiments of our framework are given in our paper. The experimental results show that BHE-AC can achieve low cost and efficient access.",

        "Title": "Blockchain Use-Case in Ballistics and Crime Gun Tracing and Intelligence: Towards Overcoming Gun Violence",
        "Abstract": "In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. While legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, and so on. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. This is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.",

        "Title": "A Blockchain-empowered Access Control Framework for Smart Devices in Green Internet of Things",
        "Abstract": "Green Internet of things (GIoT) generally refers to a new generation of Internet of things design concept. It can save energy and reduce emissions, reduce environmental pollution, waste of resources, and harm to human body and environment, in which green smart device (GSD) is a basic unit of GIoT for saving energy. With the access of a large number of heterogeneous bottom-layer GSDs in GIoT, user access and control of GSDs have become more and more complicated. Since there is no unified GSD management system, users need to operate different GIoT applications and access different GIoT cloud platforms when accessing and controlling these heterogeneous GSDs. This fragmented GSD management model not only increases the complexity of user access and control for heterogeneous GSDs, but also reduces the scalability of GSDs applications. To address this issue, this article presents a blockchain-empowered general GSD access control framework, which provides users with a unified GSD management platform. First, based on the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) decentralized identifiers (DIDs) standard, users and GSD are issued visual identity (VID). Then, we extended the GSD-DIDs protocol to authenticate devices and users. Finally, based on the characteristics of decentralization and non-tampering of blockchain, a unified access control system for GSD was designed, including the registration, granting, and revoking of access rights. We implement and test on the Raspberry Pi device and the FISCO-BCOS alliance chain. The experimental results prove that the framework provides a unified and feasible way for users to achieve decentralized, lightweight, and fine-grained access control of GSDs. The solution reduces the complexity of accessing and controlling GSDs, enhances the scalability of GSD applications, as well as guarantees the credibility and immutability of permission data and identity data during access.",

        "Abstract": "Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple edge devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants\u2019 activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, which means a trustworthy central authority is needed which has disadvantages, including vulnerable to attacks, not always credible, and hard to calculate rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the problems mentioned above. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods as well as techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work provides a comprehensive survey on challenges, solutions, and future directions about blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes, namely decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-based Framework for Reducing Fake or Vicious News Spread on Social Media/Messaging Platforms",
        "Abstract": "With social media becoming the most frequently used mode of modern-day communications, the propagation of fake or vicious news through such modes of communication has emerged as a serious problem. The scope of the problem of fake or vicious news may range from rumour-mongering, with intent to defame someone, to manufacturing false opinions/trends impacting elections and stock exchanges to much more alarming and mala fide repercussions of inciting violence by bad actors, especially in sensitive law-and-order situations. Therefore, curbing fake or vicious news and identifying the source of such news to ensure strict accountability is the need of the hour. Researchers have been working in the area of using text analysis, labelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques for detecting fake news, but identifying the source or originator of such news for accountability is still a big challenge for which no concrete approach exists as of today. Also, there is another common problematic trend on social media whereby targeted vicious content goes viral to mobilize or instigate people with malicious intent to destabilize normalcy in society. In the proposed solution, we treat both problems of fake news and vicious news together. We propose a blockchain and keyed watermarking-based framework for social media/messaging platforms that will allow the integrity of the posted content as well as ensure accountability on the owner/user of the post. Intrinsic properties of blockchain-like transparency and immutability are advantageous for curbing fake or vicious news. After identification of fake or vicious news, its spread will be immediately curbed through backtracking as well as forward tracking. Also, observing transactions on the blockchain, the density and rate of forwarding of a particular original message going beyond a threshold can easily be checked, which could be identified as a possible malicious attempt to spread objectionable content. If the content is deemed dangerous or inappropriate, its spread will be curbed immediately. The use of the Raft consensus algorithm and bloXroute servers is proposed to enhance throughput and network scalability, respectively. Thus, the framework offers a proactive as well as reactive, practically feasible, and effective solution for curtailment of fake or vicious news on social media/messaging platforms. The proposed work is a framework for solving fake or vicious news spread problems on social media; the complete design specifications are beyond scope of the current work and will be addressed in the future.",

        "Title": "Storage State Analysis and Extraction of Ethereum Blockchain Smart Contracts",
        "Abstract": "In migrating and upgrading an Ethereum smart contract, it is necessary to transfer both the code as well as the stored data. Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree (AST) and the control flow graphs (CFG) of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv\u2019s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain interoperability is emerging as one of the crucial features of blockchain technology, but the knowledge necessary for achieving it is fragmented. This fact makes it challenging for academics and the industry to achieve interoperability among blockchains seamlessly. Given this new domain\u2019s novelty and potential, we conduct a literature review on blockchain interoperability by collecting 284 papers and 120 grey literature documents, constituting a corpus of 404 documents. From those 404 documents, we systematically analyzed and discussed 102 documents, including peer-reviewed papers and grey literature. Our review classifies studies in three categories: Public Connectors, Blockchain of Blockchains, and Hybrid Connectors. Each category is further divided into sub-categories based on defined criteria. We classify 67 existing solutions in one sub-category using the Blockchain Interoperability Framework, providing a holistic overview of blockchain interoperability. Our findings show that blockchain interoperability has a much broader spectrum than cryptocurrencies and cross-chain asset transfers. Finally, this article discusses supporting technologies, standards, use cases, open challenges, and future research directions, paving the way for research in the area.",

        "Title": "Is my transaction done yet? An empirical study of transaction processing times in the Ethereum Blockchain Platform",
        "Abstract": "Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as \u00d0Apps. When engineering \u00d0Apps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective \u00d0Apps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., \u00d0App developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8m. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan\u2019s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap transaction. EthGasStation\u2019s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, \u00d0App developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.",

In this paper, we survey the existing literature on post-quantum secure digital signatures that possess exotic advanced features and which are crucial cryptographic tools used in the blockchain ecosystem for (i) account management, (ii) consensus efficiency, (iii) empowering scriptless blockchain, and (iv) privacy. The exotic signatures that we particularly focus on in this work are the following: multi-/aggregate, threshold, adaptor, blind and ring signatures. Herein the term exotic refers to signatures with properties which are not just beyond the norm for signatures e.g. unforgeability, but also imbue new forms of functionalities. Our treatment of such exotic signatures includes discussions on existing challenges and future research directions in the post-quantum space. We hope that this article will help to foster further research to make post-quantum cryptography more accessible so that blockchain systems can be made ready in advance of the approaching quantum threats.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents an annotated portfolio of projects that seek to understand and communicate the social and societal implications of blockchains, DLTs and smart contracts. These complex technologies rely on human and technical factors to deliver cryptocurrencies, shared computation and trustless protocols but have a secondary benefit in providing a moment to re-think many aspects of society, and imagine alternative possibilities. The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging publics, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology. This paints a comprehensive picture of how HCI and design can shape understandings of the future of complex technologies.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains, in general, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, in particular, are realized using distributed systems and hence critically rely on the performance and security of the interconnecting network. The requirements on these networks and their usage, however, can differ significantly from traditional communication networks, with implications on all layers of the protocol stack. This article is motivated by these differences and, in particular, by the observation that many fundamental design aspects of these networks are not well-understood today. To support the networking community to contribute to this emerging application domain, we present a structured overview of the field, from topology and neighbor discovery, over block and transaction propagation, to sharding and off-chain networks, also reviewing existing empirical results from different measurement studies. In particular, for each of these domains, we provide the context, highlighting differences and commonalities with traditional networks, review the state-of-the-art, and identify open research challenges. Our article can hence also be seen as a call-to-arms to improve the foundation on top of which blockchains are built.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of hybrid blockchain database systems, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of the performance and trade-offs among a few representative systems. To achieve this goal, we implement Veritas and BlockchainDB from scratch. For Veritas, we provide two flavors to target the crash fault-tolerant (CFT) and Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) application scenarios. Specifically, we implement Veritas with Apache Kafka to target CFT application scenarios, and Veritas with Tendermint to target BFT application scenarios. We compare these three systems with the existing open-source implementation of BigchainDB. BigchainDB uses Tender-mint for consensus and provides two flavors: a default implementation with blockchain pipelining and an optimized version that includes blockchain pipelining and parallel transaction validation. Our experimental analysis confirms that CFT designs, which are typically used by distributed databases, exhibit much higher performance than BFT designs, which are specific to blockchains. On the other hand, our extensive analysis highlights the variety of design choices faced by the developers and sheds some light on the trade-offs that need to be done when designing a hybrid blockchain database system.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasing prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply-chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanism to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain paradigm provides a mechanism for content dissemination and distributed consensus on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. While this paradigm has been widely adopted in industry, it has not been carefully analyzed in terms of its network scaling with respect to the number of peers. Applications for blockchain systems, such as cryptocurrencies and IoT, require this form of network scaling. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic network model for a blockchain system. We identify a structural property called one-endedness, which we show to be desirable in any blockchain system as it is directly related to distributed consensus among the peers. We show that the stochastic stability of the network is sufficient for the one-endedness of a blockchain. We further establish that our model belongs to a class of network models, called monotone separable models. This allows us to establish upper and lower bounds on the stability region. The bounds on stability depend on the connectivity of the P2P network through its conductance and allow us to analyze the scalability of blockchain systems on large P2P networks. We verify our theoretical insights using both synthetic data and real data from the Bitcoin network.",

        "Title": "Towards Interconnected Blockchains: A Comprehensive Review of the Role of Interoperability among Disparate Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Unprecedented attention towards blockchain technology is serving as a game-changer in fostering the development of blockchain-enabled distinctive frameworks. However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI\u2019s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains. Furthermore, this article proposes an in-depth BI research taxonomy and provides an insight into the state-of-the-art projects. Finally, it determines possible open challenges and future research in the domain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.",

At the core of these applications are consensus protocols that securely replicate client requests among all replicas, even if some replicas are Byzantine faulty. Unfortunately, these consensus protocols typically have low throughput, and this lack of performance is often cited as the reason for the slow wider adoption of blockchain technology. Consequently, many works focus on designing more efficient consensus protocols to increase throughput of consensus.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a definite IoT connecting atmosphere that contracts with communication via intelligent medical equipment. Activity detection, motion tracking, information extraction, consumer retrieval, etc., have all been solved due to advances in the autonomous study of human behavior from multimedia information processing. Though the IoT connecting atmosphere enables and provisions our daily actions, it too has certain disadvantages. IoTgrieves from numerous safety and confidentiality challenges, such as reiteration, impersonation, man-in-the-middle, remote hijacking, privileged-insider attack, denial of service (DoS) attacks, password guessing, and malware bouts. Hence, in this paper, Private Blockchain and Fuzzy Logic based Attack Detection system (PBFL-ADS) has been proposed for secure IoMT disease prediction using Multimedia Information Processing techniques. The proposed method utilizes Bayesian inference-based trust administration to perceived malevolent nodes in Health Smartphone Structures (HSS) for PBFL-ADS. This paper focuses on the specific form of IoMT called HSS because smartphones have been widely used in the healthcare profession. Then, blockchains have been utilized to improve Bayesian trust management's efficacy in detecting hostile nodes in HSSs. The effectiveness of the suggested technique has been assessed, and test results show that blockchain technology helps identify fraudulent nodes with an acceptable workload. The proposed PBFL-ADS method increases the HS2 scenario 1.1, processor utilization at nodes 33.5%, pattern recognition ratio 92.1%.and server utilization 40.1%.",

        "Abstract": "Garg et al. (TCC 2018) defined the notion of registration-based encryption (RBE) where the private key generator (PKG) is decoupled from key management and replaced by a key curator (KC). KC does not possess any cryptographic secrets and only plays the role of aggregating the public keys of all the registered users and updating the public parameters whenever a new user joins the system, which solves the key escrow issue. Notwithstanding, RBE still places a significant amount of trust in KC, whose actions are not accountable, e.g., it could secretly register multiple keys for already registered users. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based RBE framework, which provides total transparency and decentralization of KC by leveraging smart contracts. Our framework transfers the right of key management from KC to individual participants and keeps publicly upgradeable parameters on-chain. We provide a basic construction that calculates the public parameter on-chain and an extended construction with better efficiency, which merely calculates the roots of trees on-chain. Our basic version is theoretically feasible, while the extended version is practically feasible. In particular, the enhanced scheme reduces computing complexity to a constant level. Our prototype implementation and evaluation results demonstrate that our extended construction is satisfactorily efficient.",

In existing solutions, certification authorities need to record all pairs of identities and pseudonyms, which is demanding and costly. This article proposed an account guarantee scheme to realize feasible supervision for existing anonymous blockchain networks with lower storage costs. Users are able to guarantee anonymous accounts with account guarantee key pairs generated from certificated polynomial functions, which inherently maintains one-to-n mapping certifications. Single or limited account guarantee key pairs do not leak privacy. Victims are able to request TCs to screen a cheater or disclose a cheater with enough fraud transactions by themselves. Detailed security and privacy analysis showed that the account guarantee scheme preserves user privacy and realizes feasible supervision. Experimental results demonstrated that the account guarantee scheme is efficient and practical.",

        "Abstract": "The advances of Internet technology has resulted in the rapid and pervasive development of e-commerce, which has not only changed the production and operation mode of many enterprises, but also affected the economic development mode of the whole society. This trend has incurred a strong need to store and process large amounts of sensitive data. The traditional data storage and search solutions cannot meet such requirements. To tackle this problem, in this article, we proposed Consortium Blockchain-based Distributed Secure Search (CBDSS) Scheme over encrypted data in e-Commerce environment. By integrating the blockchain and searchable encryption model, sensitive data can be effectively protected. The consortium blockchain can ensure that only authorized nodes can join the system. To fairly assign nodes for the search tasks, we developed an endorsement strategy in which two agent roles are set up to divide and match the search tasks with the virtual resources according to the load capacity of each node. The security analysis and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme. The evaluation results have proved the reliability and security of our scheme over existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology provides a secure and reliable platform for managing data in various application areas, such as supply chain management, multimedia, financial sector, food sector, Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, and many more. The recent emergence of blockchain with IoT provides significant growth in the healthcare industry to improve security, privacy, efficiency, and transparency with more business opportunities. Nevertheless, conventional healthcare schemes suffer from various security attacks like collusion, phishing, masquerade, etc. Therefore, a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) is proposed in this paper using blockchain technology to create and maintain healthcare certificates. Here, the distributed application provides an interface between the blockchain network and system objects like healthcare centers, verifiers, and regular authorities to generate and issue medical documents. In addition, it also ensures security by specifying rules using various smart contracts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, various experimental tests are conducted using the Etherscan tool for measuring operation cost, latency, and processing time. Here, the efficiency of the proposed system is also compared to the existing systems in terms of latency, throughput, and response time. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that the proposed work is more efficient than the existing techniques.",

In presenting suggestions for using blockchain as a tool to teach core computer science concepts, the authors reflect on student-centered, research-based projects spent understanding blockchain and developing an elementary implementation. Their experiences led to several teachable moments applicable to many topics across CS curricula including software design, algorithms and data structures, and distributed computing. The authors discuss many definitions of blockchain filtered through the philosophical lens of essence and accidents, give a precise definition of \"essential\" blockchain, and provide insight to understanding blockchain by presenting several of its structures and their implementation in the context of those curricular topics.",

        "Title": "Courses of blockchain technology to teach at a career-oriented college",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has evolved from a hype to a technical reality and is quickly becoming a demanded skill. Career-oriented colleges are facing the challenge to incorporate blockchain technology into existing curriculum. While lacking instructional and curriculum models, educators must (a) identify the knowledge domains of blockchain technology, (b) classify their topical areas, and (c) place them in suitable academic subjects (programming, management, or business laws), before being able to determine the appropriate level of instructions and pedagogies. This paper describes a model designed and used to evaluate what topical areas of blockchain technology are practical to teach at a career-oriented college. The evaluation is based on seven factors: (1) maturity of technology, (2) impacts on management, (3) real-world applications, (4) subject classification, (5) knowledge prerequisites, (6) textbook readiness, and (7) recommended pedagogies. The evaluation results are presented by a rating scale ranging from 1 to 5 indicating the degree of \"appropriateness\" of instruction at college level. A set of territorial indicators also help to clarify the subject territory (computer science, business, or law). This paper suggests to: (1) offer all majors with an introductory course for students to understand what blockchain is and how it applies to business, (2) teach a cryptocurrency-centered course that engages students of technical majors with in-depth discussion of sciences and technologies that drive blockchain, and, if instructionally feasible, (3) guide CS and CIS majors through a project-based programming course for experiencing how to code blockchain applications.",

Since reciprocal activities among both familiar/unfamiliar strangers and acquaintances are quite common in PSN, it is essential to offer trust information to PSN users. Past work normally evaluates trust based on a centralized party, which is not feasible due to the dynamic changes of PSN topology and its specific characteristics. The literature still lacks a decentralized trust evaluation scheme in PSN. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized system for trust evaluation in PSN, called Social-Chain. Considering mobile devices normally lack computing resources to process cryptographic puzzle calculation, we design a lightweight consensus mechanism based on Proof-of-Trust (PoT), which remarkably improves system effectivity compared with other blockchain systems. Serious security analysis and experimental results further illustrate the security and efficiency of Social-Chain for being feasibly applied into PSN.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a world with rapid development and implementations to change our everyday lives based on smart devices. These devices are attached to the internet that can communicate with each other without human interference. A well-known wireless network in blockchain-enabled IoT frameworks is the Low Power and Lossy Network (LLN) that uses a novel protocol known as Routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) to provide effective and energy-efficient routing. LLNs that run on RPL are inherently prone to multiple Denial of Service (DoS) attacks due to the low cost, shared medium and resource-constrained nature of blockchain-enabled IoT devices. A Spam DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack is one of the novel attacks that drain the energy source of legitimate nodes and ends up causing the legitimate nodes to suffer from DoS. To address this problem, a mitigation scheme named DIS Spam Attack Mitigation (DISAM) is proposed. The proposed scheme effectively mitigates the effects of the Spam DIS attack on the network\u2019s performance. The experimental results show that DISAM detects and mitigates the attack quickly and efficiently.",

        "Title": "RTChain: A Reputation System with Transaction and Consensus Incentives for E-commerce Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology, whose most successful application is Bitcoin, enables non-repudiation and non-tamperable online transactions without the participation of a trusted central party. As a global ledger, the blockchain achieves the consistency of replica stored on each node through a consensus mechanism. A well-designed consensus mechanism, on one hand, needs to be efficient to meet the high frequency of online transactions. For example, the existing electronic payment systems can handle over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), while Bitcoin can only handle an average of about 3TPS. On the other hand, it needs to have good security and high fault tolerance; that is, in the case when some nodes are captured by adversaries, the network can still operate normally. In this article, we establish a reputation system, called RTChain, to be integrated into the e-commerce blockchain to achieve a distributed consensus and transaction incentives. The proposed scheme has the following advantages. First, an incentive mechanism is used to influence the consensus behavior of nodes and the transaction behavior of users, which in turn influence the reputation scores of both nodes and users. That is, when a node correctly processes a transaction, it will receive the corresponding reputation value as a reward, and the reputation value will be reduced as punishment not only when the node is dishonest and violates the consensus agreement but also the transaction is not completed as required. Just like electronic transactions in the real world, the higher the reputation of the user, the more likely it is to be selected as the transaction partner. A user with a low reputation will be gradually eliminated in our system because it is difficult to complete the transaction. Second, RTChain uses a verifiable random function to generate the leader in each round, which guarantees fairness for all participants and, unlike PoW, does not consume a large amount of computing resources. Then our consensus mechanism selects the nodes with high reputation scores to reduce the number of nodes participating in the consensus, thus improving the consensus efficiency, so that RTChain\u2019s throughput can reach 4,000TPS. Third, we built a reputation chain to implement the distributed storage and management of reputation. Finally, our consensus mechanism is secure against existing attacks, such as flash attacks, selfish mining attacks, eclipse attacks, and double spending attacks, and allows nodes that participate in the consensus to fail, as long as the reputation of the failure node does not exceed one-third of the total reputation. We build a prototype of RTChain, and the experimental results show that RTChain is promising and deployable for e-commerce blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), a large-scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic distributed network has been formed among IoT devices. There is an extreme need to establish a trust mechanism between devices, and blockchain can provide a zero-trust security framework for IoT. However, the efficiency of the blockchain is far from meeting the application requirements of the IoT, which has become the biggest resistance to the application of the blockchain in the IoT. Therefore, this paper combines sharding to build an effective Blockchain-based IoT data storage scheme (S-BDS). Sharding can solve the problem of blockchain capacity and scalability. While the blockchain provides data immutability and traceability for the IoT, it also brings huge demand for data credibility verification. The communication delay in the IoT system seriously affects the security of the system, while the Merkle proof of traditional blockchain occupies a lot of communication resources. This paper constructs Insertable Vector Commitment (IVC) in the bilinear group and replaces the Merkle tree with IVC to store IoT data in the blockchain. The construct has small-sized proof. It also has the ability to record the number of updates, which can prevent replay-attacks. Experiments show that each block processes 1000 transactions, the proof size of a single data piece is 30% of the original scheme, and proofs from different shards can be aggregated. IVC can effectively reduce communication congestion and improve the stability and security of the IoT system.",

        "Abstract": "The sensing-as-a-service (SaaS) model has been explored to address the challenge of intractability of managing a large number of sensors faced by future smart cities. However, how to effectively share sensor data without compromising confidentiality, privacy protection, and fair trading without third parties is one of critical issues that must be solved in the SaaS in smart cities. While blockchain shows promise in solving these issues, the existing blockchain-based data sharing (BBDS) systems are difficult to apply to SaaS in smart cities because of many unresolved issues such as requiring a customized blockchain, huge storage, communication and computation costs, and dependence on a third party to achieve fair trading. We propose a BBDS system model with its security requirements before we present a concrete construction by combining\n-protocol, Paillier encryption scheme, and any secure symmetrical encryption and signature schemes. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed BBDS system, we present a security analysis and compare our system with other solutions. We implement the prototype in Remix to analyze the gas cost, and we conduct experiments to evaluate the communication and computation costs of the BBDS system using symmetric encryption (advanced encryption standard (AES)) and a signature scheme (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)).",

        "Abstract": "To draw a roadmap of current research activities of the blockchain community, we first conduct a brief overview of state-of-the-art blockchain surveys published in the past 5 years. We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.",

The main underlying data structure is blockchain, a scalable fully replicated structure that is shared among all participants and guarantees a consistent view of all user transactions by all participants in the cryptocurrency system. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem.

        "Abstract": "Different malicious activities occur in cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Some activities are due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities which are present in the blockchain infrastructure, some activities target its users through social engineering techniques, while some activities use it to facilitate different malicious activities. Since cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide pseudonymity to its users, bad actors prefer to carry out transactions related to malicious activities on them. Towards this, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts as suspects that indulge in malicious activities, thus reducing the unintended support that cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide to malicious actors. We first use the cosine similarity (CS) metrics to study the similarities between the feature vector of accounts associated with different malicious activities and find that most of the malicious activities associated with the Ethereum blockchain behave similarly. We then use the K-Means clustering algorithm to check if accounts associated with similar malicious activities cluster together. We also study the effect of bias on the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, due to the number of accounts associated with malicious activity. We then compare the different state-of-the-art models and identify that Neural Networks (NNs) are resistant to bias associated with a malicious activity and are also robust against adversarial attacks. The previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts also show bias towards an over-represented malicious activity.",

        "Abstract": "The success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is drawing significant interest to blockchains. A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures the entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing. In this paper, we identify a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. We first motivate the need for adding native provenance support to blockchains. We then present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes lineage information to smart contracts runtime via simple and elegant interfaces that efficiently and securely support provenance-dependent contracts. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution and stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for efficient provenance queries. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Fabric and a blockchain optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its high query performance and its small storage overhead.",

        "Title": "RobustPay<sup>&#x002B;</sup>: Robust Payment Routing With Approximation Guarantee in Blockchain-Based Payment Channel Networks",
        "Abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even the leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve the cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers the off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. However, transaction failures may occur due to external attacks or unexpected conditions, e.g., an uncooperative user becoming unresponsive. In this paper, we present a distributed robust payment routing protocol <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RobustPay^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> to resist transaction failures, which achieves robustness, efficiency, distributedness and approximate optimization. Specifically, we investigate the problem of robust routing in PCNs from an optimization perspective, which is to find a pair of payment paths for a payment request, while minimizing the worst-case transaction fee, subject to the timeliness and feasibility constraints. We present a distributed 2-approximation algorithm for this problem. Moreover, we modify the original Hashed Time-lock Contract (HTLC) protocol and adapt it to the robust payment routing protocol to achieve robustness and efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RobustPay^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of the success ratio and the average accepted value",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles(IoV) enables vehicles to generate and share messages to improve transportation safety and efficiency, especially in a smart city scenario where modern communication technology is utilized. The current IoV, however, faces three main issues: (1) existing frameworks fail to build a complete data management system, (2) received messages in an untrusted environment are challenging to assess for credibility, and (3) the centralized ways to store data are causing severe security and efficiency problems. Blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV) provides an opportunity for addressing these issues. This paper proposes a trusted paradigm of data management based on a vehicle\u2013road\u2013cloud architecture. A few-shot learning model, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) sampling is designed to evaluate whether the uploading message is malicious. This paper also proposes the novel group-weighted-decay Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm, an improved version of PBFT to store data, and provides a comprehensive review of its viability and data management procedures. By employing the joint gwd-PBFT and Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus, the method mitigates the issue of excessive incentives. According to simulation results, the system's overall efficiency can be increased while retaining security and availability.",

        "Abstract": "The digital transformation of the medical sector requires solutions that are convenient and efficient for all stakeholders while protecting patients\u2019 sensitive data. One example that has already attracted design-oriented research are medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic prescription management systems typically create centralized data silos, leaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding interoperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on blockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored. We conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the exchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a digital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized double-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing approaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control over their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and scalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management solutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on how to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require both the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain platforms are coming into use for processing critical transactions among participants who have not established mutual trust. Many blockchains are programmable, supporting smart contracts, which maintain persistent state and support transactions that transform the state. Unfortunately, bugs in many smart contracts have been exploited by hackers. Obsidian is a novel programming language with a type system that enables static detection of bugs that are common in smart contracts today. Obsidian is based on a core calculus, Silica, for which we proved type soundness. Obsidian uses typestate to detect improper state manipulation and uses linear types to detect abuse of assets. We integrated a permissions system that encodes a notion of ownership to allow for safe, flexible aliasing. We describe two case studies that evaluate Obsidian\u2019s applicability to the domains of parametric insurance and supply chain management, finding that Obsidian\u2019s type system facilitates reasoning about high-level states and ownership of resources. We compared our Obsidian implementation to a Solidity implementation, observing that the Solidity implementation requires much boilerplate checking and tracking of state, whereas Obsidian does this work statically.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) has become the backbone of innumerable multimedia applications in various fields. The wide application of IoMT not only makes our life convenient but also brings challenges to service discovery. Service discovery aims to leverage location information and trust evidence scattered in a variety of multimedia applications to find trusted IoMT devices that can provide specific service in target areas. However, the eavesdropping and tampering to these sensitive IoMT data during the trust propagation process invalidate the service discovery process. To address these challenges, we propose Secure Service Discovery (SSD) for IoMT using cross-blockchain-enabled fog computing. To resist the tampering and eavesdropping during the trust propagation process, a scalable cross-blockchain structure consisting of multiple parallel blockchains is first proposed based on fog, in which different parallel blockchains can be orchestrated to propagate encrypted location information and trust evidence of different applications. Moreover, to enable a cross-blockchain structure to leverage encrypted location information and trust evidence to find trusted IoMT devices in preset areas, a novel privacy-preserving range query is proposed to query and aggregate trust evidence. Security analysis and simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and security of the proposed SSD.",

        "Title": "From Trustworthy Data to Trustworthy IoT: A Data Collection Methodology Based on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of physical devices, communication networks, and services provided by edge systems and over-the-top applications. IoT connects billions of devices that collect data from the physical environment, which are pre-processed at the edge and then forwarded to processing services at the core of the infrastructure, on top of which cloud-based applications are built and provided to mobile end users. IoT comes with important advantages in terms of applications and added value for its users, making their world smarter and simpler. These advantages, however, are mitigated by the difficulty of guaranteeing IoT trustworthiness, which is still in its infancy. IoT trustworthiness is a must especially in critical domains (e.g., health, transportation) where humans become new components of an IoT system and their life is put at risk by system malfunctioning or breaches. In this article, we put forward the idea that trust in IoT can be boosted if and only if its automation and adaptation processes are based on trustworthy data. We therefore depart from a scenario that considers the quality of a single decision as the main goal of an IoT system and consider the trustworthiness of collected data as a fundamental requirement at the basis of a trustworthy IoT environment. We therefore define a methodology for data collection that filters untrusted data out according to trust rules evaluating the status of the devices collecting data and the collected data themselves. Our approach is based on blockchain and smart contracts and collects data whose trustworthiness and integrity are proven over time. The methodology balances trustworthiness and privacy and is experimentally evaluated in real-world and simulated scenarios using Hyperledger fabric blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are a key component of today\u2019s blockchains. They are critical in controlling decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). However, smart contracts are not yet legally binding nor enforceable; this makes it difficult for businesses to adopt the DAO paradigm. Therefore, this study reviews existing Smart Contract Languages (SCL) and identifies properties that are critical to any future SCL for drafting legally binding contracts. This is achieved by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of white- and grey literature published between 2015 and 2019. Using the SLR methodology, 45 Selected and 28 Supporting Studies detailing 45 state-of-the-art SCLs are selected. Finally, 10 SCL properties that enable legally compliant DAOs are discovered, and specifications for developing SCLs are explored.",

        "Abstract": "At present, clients can outsource lots of complex and abundant computation, e.g., Internet of things (IoT), tasks to clouds by the \u201cpay as you go\u201d model. Outsourcing computation can save costs for clients and fully utilize the existing cloud infrastructures. However, it is hard for clients to trust the clouds even if blockchain is used as the trusted platform. In this article, we utilize the verification method as SETI@home by only two rational clouds, who hope to maximize their utilities. Utilities are defined as the incomes of clouds when they provide computation results to clients. More specifically, one client outsources two jobs to two clouds and each job contains n tasks, which include k identical sentinels. Two clouds can either honestly compute each task or collude on the identical sentinel tasks by agreeing on random values. If the results of identical sentinels are identical, then client regards the jobs as correctly computed without verification. Obviously, rational clouds have incentives to deviate by collusion and provide identical random results for a higher income. We discuss how to prevent collusion by using deposits, e.g., bit-coins. Furthermore, utilities for each cloud can be automatically assigned by a smart contract. We prove that, given proper parameters, two rational clouds will honestly send correct results to the client without collusion.",

All blockchains achieve a common goal: building a decentralized system that provides a trustworthy service in an untrustworthy environment. A blockchain builds a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) system in which decentralized nodes run a protocol to reach an agreement on the common system state. In this article, we focus on the research of BFT protocols. In particular, we categorize BFT protocols according to both the system models and workflow. We seek to answer these important questions: How has the research in BFT evolved in the past four decades, especially with the rise of blockchains? What are the driven needs for BFT research in the future?",

Blockchain has evolved to become a generic approach to store and process data in a highly decentralized and secure way. In this article, we review blockchain concepts and use cases, and discuss the challenges in using them from a governmental viewpoint. We begin with reviewing the categories of blockchains, the underlying mechanisms, and why blockchains can achieve their security goals. We then review existing known governmental use cases by regions. To show both technical and deployment details of blockchain adoption, we study a few representative use cases in the domains of healthcare and energy infrastructures. Finally, the review of both technical details and use cases helps us summarize the adoption and technical challenges of blockchains.",

Service providers have provided more diverse and extensive information services. With the recent evolution to a customized service, the demand for the use of personal information is increasing. However, it affects the efficiency and convenience of service provision, as social problems and security threats such as personal information leakage, human trafficking, and misuse increase. In this article, we proposed an intelligent mediator-based enhanced smart contract for privacy protection. The proposed approach performs the tasks, which are mediation transactions, authorization, and transaction record management, with blockchain-based personal information management. Then it is possible to prevent misuse of personal information and to support rational decision-making on the transparency of information and the use of personal information by autonomously performing personal information management.",

        "Abstract": "Korean education-related evaluation agencies utilize a centralized system that directly manages learner data. This leaves the intellectual property of the organizations and the personal information of the students vulnerable to leakage should the central server be attacked. In this study, the researchers propose a multilateral personal portfolio authentication system that guarantees the reliability, integrity, and transparency of the data such as learner's schooling history. The system uses the features of blockchain in a distributed network wherein a learner submits schooling data to a peer in the network. The data is then verified through an agreement among the peers and recorded in a chronologically encrypted ledger. The proposed system is implemented based on Hyperledger Fabric and the analysis thereof conducted by evaluating its processing speed, capacity, and security. The analysis indicates that the system is able to successfully intercept the transactions of unvalidated users, thereby preventing the recording of incorrect data by an unauthorized user. Furthermore, it provides a record of previously made changes to a learner's profile, thus improving the integrity and reliability of the data. This system provides a platform to share learner information safely and promptly among schools, certification authorities, and higher learning institutions.",

        "Title": "Tuxedo: Maximizing Smart Contract Computation in PoW Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time (I) between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time (\u03c4) introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large \u03c4 also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve. In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale \u03c4/I \u22481 in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to \u03b6 blocks, where \u03b6 is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay \u0394 and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale \u03c4 without suffering the harmful effects of naive scaling up of \u03c4/I in existing blockchains",

        "Title": "FlexChain: an elastic disaggregated blockchain",
        "Abstract": "While permissioned blockchains enable a family of data center applications, existing systems suffer from imbalanced loads across compute and memory, exacerbating the underutilization of cloud resources. This paper presents FlexChain, a novel permissioned blockchain system that addresses this challenge by physically disaggregating CPUs, DRAM, and storage devices to process different blockchain workloads efficiently. Disaggregation allows blockchain service providers to upgrade and expand hardware resources independently to support a wide range of smart contracts with diverse CPU and memory demands. Moreover, it ensures efficient resource utilization and hence prevents resource fragmentation in a data center. We have explored the design of XOV blockchain systems in a disaggregated fashion and developed a tiered key-value store that can elastically scale its memory and storage. Our design significantly speeds up the execution stage. We have also leveraged several techniques to parallelize the validation stage in FlexChain to further improve the overall blockchain performance. Our evaluation results show that FlexChain can provide independent compute and memory scalability, while incurring at most 12.8% disaggregation overhead. FlexChain achieves almost identical throughput as the state-of-the-art distributed approaches with significantly lower memory and CPU consumption for compute-intensive and memory-intensive workloads respectively.",

        "Title": "CAPER: a cross-application permissioned blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability.",

        "Title": "Three-tier Storage Framework Based on TBchain and IPFS for Protecting IoT Security and Privacy",
        "Abstract": "Recently, most of the Internet of things (IoT) infrastructures are highly centralized with single points of failure, which results in serious security and privacy issues of IoT data. Fortunately, blockchain technique can provide a decentralized and secure IoT framework to deal with security issues based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, openness, transparency and traceability. However, the blockchain consensus protocol guarantees the safety and reliability of data, but it also brings problems such as scalability limitations and poor storage extensibility, resulting in the inability to directly integrate blockchain and the IoT in existing conditions. In this paper, a private three-tier local blockchain, Three-tier architecture Blockchain (TBchain), is proposed to solve the problem by splitting part of the transactions in the public blockchain and locking them in a higher-level blockchain TBchain. Additionally, the private blockchain TBchain is connected to the public blockchain to build a hierarchical blockchain network to provide privacy protection for the IoT data stored on the blockchain. Finally, we implement an IoT framework based on TBchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to realize the decentralized IoT, which guarantees the user\u2019s access control right to personal data. Experimental results show that the IoT framework based on TBchain and IPFS realizes the user\u2019s access control right to personal data by verifying in advance to ensure the confidentiality and security of shared data, and improves the security and privacy of IoT data and transactions. Moreover, we prove that the scalability and storage extensibility of the blockchain is positively correlated with the number of data blocks in TBchain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing\u2014Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.",

        "Title": "NeuChain: a fast permissioned blockchain system with deterministic ordering",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain serves as a replicated transactional processing system in a trustless distributed environment. Existing blockchain systems all rely on an explicit ordering step to determine the global order of transactions that are collected from multiple peers. The ordering consensus can be the bottleneck since it must be Byzantine-fault tolerant and can scarcely benefit from parallel execution. In this paper, we propose an ordering-free architecture that makes ordering implicit through deterministic execution. Based on this novel architecture, we develop a permissioned blockchain system NeuChain. A number of key optimizations such as asynchronous block generation and pipelining are leveraged for high throughput and low latency. Several security mechanisms are also designed to make our system robust to malicious attacks. Our geo-distributed experimental results show that NeuChain can achieve 47.2--64.1X throughput improvement over HyperLedger Fabric and 1.6--12.2X throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art high performance blockchains.",

Permissioned blockchains place special emphasis on transactions throughput. In this paper we present FireLedger, which leverages the iterative nature of blockchains in order to improve their throughput in optimistic execution scenarios. FireLedger trades latency for throughput in the sense that in FireLedger the last f + 1 blocks of each node's blockchain are considered tentative, i.e., they may be rescinded in case one of the last f + 1 blocks proposers was Byzantine. Yet, when optimistic assumptions are met, a new block is decided in each communication step, which consists of a proposer that sends only its proposal and all other participants are sending a single bit each. In our performance study FireLedger obtained 20% -- 600% better throughput than state of the art protocols like HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt, depending on the configuration.",

        "Abstract": "Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual\u2019s privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant\u2019s data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain\u2019s challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant\u2019s privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants.",

        "Title": "Smart Contract Languages: A Multivocal Mapping Study",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has attracted the attention of the scientific community and companies, as proven by the exponential growth of publications on this topic in recent years. This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies. As a result of the implementation of the review protocol, 4,119 papers were gathered, and 109 of them were selected for extraction. The contributions of this article are twofold: (1) 101 different smart contract languages have been identified and classified according to a variety of criteria; (2) a discussion on the findings and their implications for future research have been outlined. As a conclusion, it could be stated that a rigorous and replicable overview of the state-of-the-art of smart contract languages has been provided that can benefit not only researchers but also practitioners in the field, thanks to its multivocal nature.",

        "Abstract": "Malware detection approaches have been extensively studied for traditional software systems. However, the development of blockchain technology has promoted the birth of a new type of software system\u2013decentralized applications. Composed of smart contracts, a type of application that implements the Ponzi scheme logic (called smart Ponzi schemes) has caused irreversible loss and hindered the development of blockchain technology. These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas). The experiment results show that MulCas can achieve higher performance and robustness in the scope of our dataset. Most importantly, the proposed method can identify smart Ponzi scheme at the creation time.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains store transaction data in the form of a distributed ledger where each node in the network stores a current copy of the sequence of transactions as a hash chain. This requirement of storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks. In this work we use secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to design a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of each transaction, thereby reducing the cold storage cost to a fraction of its original cost. In addition, the storage code ensures the security of the storage from active adversaries that may aim to corrupt prior transactions by altering copies of the ledger. We further employ a dynamic zone allocation algorithm that spreads the node allocation and data distribution across transactions. Under this coding scheme we show that we can also improve the integrity of the transaction data in the network over current schemes.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents SigVM, the first blockchain virtual machine that extends EVM to support an event-driven execution model, enabling developers to build truly decentralized smart contracts. Contracts in SigVM can emit signal events, on which other contracts can listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler functions are automatically executed as signal transactions. We build an end-to-end blockchain platform SigChain and a contract language compiler SigSolid to realize the potential of SigVM. Experimental results show that our benchmark applications can be reimplemented with SigVM in a truly decentralized way, eliminating the dependency on centralized and unreliable mechanisms like off-chain relay servers. The development effort of reimplementing these contracts with SigVM is small, i.e., we modified on average 3.17% of the contract code. The runtime and the gas overhead of SigVM on these contracts is negligible.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to off-chain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97% ~ 99%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4\u00d7 ~ 15.6\u00d7.",

As blockchains are used predominantly in financial applications, smart contracts frequently manage millions of dollars worth of virtual coins. Since smart contracts cannot be updated once deployed, the ability to reason about their correctness becomes a critical task. Yet, the de facto implementation standard, pioneered by the Ethereum platform, dictates smart contracts to be deployed in a low-level language, which renders independent audit and formal verification of deployed code infeasible in practice.",

        "Abstract": "Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial.",

        "Abstract": "As cryptographic tokens and altcoins are increasingly being built to serve as utility tokens, the notion of useful work consensus protocols is becoming ever more important. With useful work consensus protocols, users get rewards after they have carried out some specific tasks useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be provided, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify reliably. To deal with such cases, we design \u201cProof-of-Prestige\u201d (PoP)\u2014a reward system that can run directly on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains or as a smart contract on top of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. PoP introduces \u201cprestige,\u201d which is a volatile resource that, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services, and directly translates to users minting power. Our scheme allows us to reliably reward decentralized workers while keeping the system free for the end-users. PoP is resistant against Sybil and collusion attacks and can be used with a vast range of unverifiable tasks. We build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behavior of the system and deploy a full prototype of a content dissemination platform rewarding its participants. We implement the blockchain component on both Ethereum (PoW) and Cosmos (PoS), provide a mobile application, and connect it with our scheme with a negligible memory footprint. Finally, we adapt a fair exchange protocol allowing us to atomically exchange files for rewards also in scenarios where not all the parties have Internet connectivity. Our evaluation shows that even for large Ethereum traces, PoP introduces sub-millisecond computational overhead for miners in Cosmos and less than 0.013$ smart contract invocation cost for users in Ethereum.",

        "Abstract": "Connected vehicles are set to define the future of transportation; however, this upcoming technology continues to be plagued with serious security risks. If these risks are not addressed in a timely fashion, then they could threaten the adoption and success of this promising technology. This article deals with a specific class of attacks in connected vehicles, namely tampering attacks caused due to compromise of on-board sensors. Current centralized solutions that employ trusted infrastructure to protect against adversarial manipulation of information cannot validate the correctness of the shared data and do not scale well. To overcome these issues, decentralized protection mechanisms by means of blockchain technology have emerged as a promising research direction. However, current permission-less, linear blockchain-based solutions have low transaction performance and high computational cost, thereby making it difficult to adopt them for security in connected vehicles. In this article, we present TangleCV, a directed acyclic graph\u2013based distributed ledger technique for connected vehicles to address data tampering threats in connected vehicular networks. We describe new validation steps, tip selection strategies, and cumulative weight definition for TangleCV that not only meets the timing constraints of the connected vehicular networks but also secures the network against threats due to tampering attacks. We describe how the reputation of the network is established in TangleCV using trust factors calculated on the basis of ability, integrity, and benevolence of the nodes in the network. We present numerical results that demonstrate that the average value of the time to first approval decreases by more than 70% as the network evolves from a low load to a high load in the case of the nearest neighbor strategy. We observe that more than 60% of the nodes are approved in a low-load network and this number increases to 80% in a high-load network for the nearest neighbor strategy. The standard deviation of error measurements for nodes experiencing tampering attack is around 60% higher as compared to nodes that do not experience such an attack.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) communication platform provides seamless information exchange facilities in a dynamic mobile city environment. Heterogeneous communication is a common medium for information exchange through autonomous resources distributed and accessed using infrastructure units. Cyber-Cyber-security is a primary concern in accessing autonomous information from the distributed resources due to anonymity and different types of targeted adversaries. This paper proposes token-based authorization and authentication (TAA) for securing IoV communications. The proposed method relies on blockchain technology and random forest learning for authorization and key management for authentication respectively. In this process, frequent chance in tokens and key update features are restricted in a view to maximize the seamlessness in information exchange. Authentication is preceded with the knowledge of the data classification without errors to prevent additional overhead. Blockchain based authorization helps to update specific fields of the tokens so as to retain the communication ratio by reducing vehicle-to-vehicle losses. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using appropriate simulations for the above discussed metrics by varying the vehicles density, error rate, and classification sets.",

Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed \u201ctransactional sensitivity\u201d) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process.

        "Title": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance For Distributed Ledgers Revisited",
        "Abstract": "The problem of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) has received a lot of attention in the last 30 years. Due to the popularity of Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains in recent years, several BFT protocols have been deployed in the large scale of Internet environment. We analyze several popular BFT protocols such as Capser FFG/CBC-FBC for Ethereum 2.0 and GRANDPA for Polkadot. Our analysis shows that the security models for these BFT protocols are slightly different from the models commonly accepted in the academic literature. For example, we show that, if the adversary has a full control of the message delivery order in the underlying network, then none of the BFT protocols for Ethereum blockchain 2.0 and Polkadot blockchain could achieve liveness even in a synchronized network. Though it is not clear whether a practical adversary could actually control and re-order the underlying message delivery system (at Internet scale) to mount these attacks, it raises an interesting question on security model gaps between academic BFT protocols and deployed BFT protocols in the Internet scale. With these analysis, this article proposes a Casper CBC-FBC style binary BFT protocol and shows its security in the traditional academic security model with complete asynchronous networks. For partial synchronous networks, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol BDLS based on the seminal DLS protocol and show that it is one of the most efficient practical BFT protocols at large scale networks in the traditional academic BFT security model. The implementation of BDLS is available at https://github.com/yonggewang/bdls. Finally, we propose a multi-value BFT protocol XP for complete asynchronous networks and show its security in the traditional academic BFT security model.",

        "Title": "Proof-of-Stake in Algorand",
        "Abstract": "In the last few years, a number of blockchain-based online platforms decided to use consensus procedures other than Proof of Work (PoW), originally adopted by Bitcoin. An alternative protocol, which attracted much attention, is the so-called Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which unlike PoW consensus is not based on solving an energy-consuming cryptopuzzle, but rather on the amount of currency units owned by a user. Different platforms adopted alternative versions of PoS. In this article, we investigate a version of PoS inspired by Algorand, which embodies a number of specific features. Indeed, to confirm a new block in the chain Algorand introduces three steps: proposal, selection, and confirmation of a block. Each step is performed by randomly selected users, where draws are based on PoS. We find explicit solutions for individual money demand, under the main simplifying assumption that a user is rewarded by the system only for the first role that she's drawn for. We do so by considering both exogenous and endogenous money supply. We also discuss the monetary equilibrium of the system, an important element in the analysis because a long-lasting disequilibrium of the economy may cause disappointment and induce some users to leave the system. Our findings suggest that an equilibrium seems to be more likely to take place if users have heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, preferences.",

        "Abstract": "The recent adoption of blockchain technologies and open permissionless networks suggest the importance of peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain transaction protocols. Users should be able to atomically exchange tokens and assets without depending on centralized intermediaries such as exchanges. Recent peer-to-peer atomic cross-chain swap protocols use hashlocks and timelocks to ensure that participants comply to the protocol. However, an expired timelock could lead to a violation of the all-or-nothing atomicity property. An honest participant who fails to execute a smart contract on time due to a crash failure, denial of service attacks or even network delays might end up losing assets. Although a crashed participant is the only participant who ends up worse off, current proposals are unsuitable for atomic cross-chain transactions in asynchronous environments where crash failures and network delays are the norm. In this paper, we present AC3WN, the first decentralized all-or-nothing atomic cross-chain commitment protocol. The redeem and refund events of the smart contracts that exchange assets are modeled as conflicting events. An open permissionless network of witnesses is used to guarantee that conflicting events could never simultaneously occur and either all smart contracts in an atomic cross-chain transaction are redeemed or all of them are refunded.",

        "Abstract": "SMEs in China always face financing constraints and hardly obtain bank loans under unsound financing system due to the information asymmetry, while thousands of SMEs have contributed greatly to Chinese economic development in the last decades. Credit reporting has been verified to be an effective way to lower information asymmetry. However, existed credit reporting systems for SMEs can not meet the development of SMEs and provide enough information to the financial institutions in China. This paper introduces an active and dynamic credit reporting framework based on Big data and Blockchain for SMEs. The framework is composed of five modules, including credit data acquisition, authentication, evaluation, reporting, and interaction. And it features in capturing diversified data online, conducting evaluation and analysis in real time, generating online credit reports for users automatically, and providing an effective way for different entities to interact. A case study from a real credit evaluation company is also proposed finally to show the proposed framework.",

        "Title": "Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Routing Cryptocurrency over Payment Channel Networks",
        "Abstract": "Payment channel networks (PCNs) are viewed as one of the most promising scalability solutions for cryptocurrencies today. Roughly, PCNs are networks where each node represents a user and each directed, weighted edge represents funds escrowed on a blockchain; these funds can be transacted only between the endpoints of the edge. Users efficiently transmit funds from node A to B by relaying them over a path connecting A to B, as long as each edge in the path contains enough balance (escrowed funds) to support the transaction. Whenever a transaction succeeds, the edge weights are updated accordingly. In deployed PCNs, channel balances (i.e., edge weights) are not revealed to users for privacy reasons; users know only the initial weights at time 0. Hence, when routing transactions, users typically first guess a path, then check if it supports the transaction. This guess-and-check process dramatically reduces the success rate of transactions. At the other extreme, knowing full channel balances can give substantial improvements in transaction success rate at the expense of privacy. In this work, we ask whether a network can reveal noisy channel balances to trade off privacy for utility. We show fundamental limits on such a tradeoff, and propose noise mechanisms that achieve the fundamental limit for a general class of graph topologies. Our results suggest that in practice, PCNs should operate either in the low-privacy or low-utility regime; it is not possible to get large gains in utility by giving up a little privacy, or large gains in privacy by sacrificing a little utility.",

        "Abstract": "As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general automated market maker (AMM) framework describing the economics and formalizing the system\u2019s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top automated market maker (AMM) protocols\u2019 mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by automated market maker (AMM)-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs)\u2019 inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both decentralized finance (DeFi) and conventional market microstructure.",

        "Abstract": "Outsourcing helps relocate data from the cyber-physical system (CPS) for efficient storage at low cost. Current server-based outsourcing mainly focuses on the benefits of servers. This cannot attract users well, as their security, efficiency, and economy are not guaranteed. To solve with this issue, a hybrid outsourcing model that exploits both cloud server and edge devices to store data is needed. Meanwhile, the requirements of security and efficiency are different under specific scenarios. There is a lack of a comprehensive solution that considers all of the above issues. In this work, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first hybrid user-centric data outsourcing (HUCDO) scheme. It allows users to outsource data securely, efficiently, and economically via different CPSs. Brielly, our contributions consist of theories, implementations, and evaluations. Our theories include the first homomorphic collision-resistant chameleon hash (HCCH) and homomorphic designated-receiver signcryption (HDRS). As implementations, we instantiate how to use our proposals to outsource small- or large-scale data through distinct CPS, respectively. Additionally, a blockchain with proof-of-discrete-logarithm (B-PoDL) is instantiated to help improve our performance. Last, as demonstrated by our evaluations, our proposals are secure, efficient, and economic for users to implement while outsourcing their data via CPSs.",

One of the biggest challenges facing the clinical trial research community is satisfying Part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [7] and ISO 27789 [40]. These controls provide audit requirements that guarantee the reliability of the data contained in the electronic records. Context-aware smart devices and wearable IoT devices have become increasingly common in clinical trials. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) do not currently address the new challenges introduced using these devices. The healthcare digital threat landscape is continually evolving, and the prevalence of sensor fusion and wearable devices compounds the growing attack surface. We propose Scrybe, a permissioned blockchain, to store proof of clinical trial data provenance. We illustrate how Scrybe addresses each control and the limitations of the Ethereum-based blockchains. Finally, we provide a proof-of-concept integration with REDCap to show tamper resistance.",

        "Title": "Refiner: a reliable incentive-driven federated learning system powered by blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Modern mobile applications often produce decentralized data, i.e., a huge amount of privacy-sensitive data distributed over a large number of mobile devices. Techniques for learning models from decentralized data must properly handle two natures of such data, namely privacy and massive engagement. Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for such a learning task since the technique learns models from data without exposing privacy. However, traditional FL methods assume that the participating mobile devices are honest volunteers. This assumption makes traditional FL methods unsuitable for applications where two kinds of participants are engaged: 1) self-interested participants who, without economical stimulus, are reluctant to contribute their computing resources unconditionally, and 2) malicious participants who send corrupt updates to disrupt the learning process. This paper proposes Refiner, a reliable federated learning system for tackling the challenges introduced by massive engagements of self-interested and malicious participants. Refiner is built upon Ethereum, a public blockchain platform. To engage self-interested participants, we introduce an incentive mechanism which rewards each participant in terms of the amount of its training data and the performance of its local updates. To handle malicious participants, we propose an audit scheme which employs a committee of randomly chosen validators for punishing them with no reward and preclude corrupt updates from the global model. The proposed incentive and audit scheme is implemented with cryptocurrency and smart contract, two primitives offered by Ethereum. This paper demonstrates the main features of Refiner by training a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset.",

Through a discussion of the literature on autonomous and decentralized systems and how these imaginaries play out in the blockchain community based on my qualitative research, I demonstrate how decentralized autonomous systems are related to imaginaries about the organization of and the future of work. I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.",

        "Title": "Can advanced type systems be usable? An empirical study of ownership, assets, and typestate in Obsidian",
        "Abstract": "Some blockchain programs (smart contracts) have included serious security vulnerabilities. Obsidian is a new typestate-oriented programming language that uses a strong type system to rule out some of these vulnerabilities. Although Obsidian was designed to promote usability to make it as easy as possible to write programs, strong type systems can cause a language to be difficult to use. In particular, ownership, typestate, and assets, which Obsidian uses to provide safety guarantees, have not seen broad adoption together in popular languages and result in significant usability challenges. We performed an empirical study with 20 participants comparing Obsidian to Solidity, which is the language most commonly used for writing smart contracts today. We observed that Obsidian participants were able to successfully complete more of the programming tasks than the Solidity participants. We also found that the Solidity participants commonly inserted asset-related bugs, which Obsidian detects at compile time.",

        "Title": "SDN Controllers: A Comprehensive Analysis and Performance Evaluation Study",
        "Abstract": "Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities. This work uses three benchmarking tools to compare 9 controllers and presents a detailed analysis of their performance, along with discussion on performance of specialized network controllers.",

        "Abstract": "The transaction-rate bottleneck built into popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leads to fee markets where transactions are included according to a first-price auction for block space. Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our Machine Learning (ML) model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%. Our findings enable Bitcoin users to improve their fee expenses and the approval time for their transactions.",

        "Title": "Trade or Trick?: Detecting and Characterizing Scam Tokens on Uniswap Decentralized Exchange",
        "Abstract": "The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the need for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the security and privacy issues of traditional CEX. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap V2 exchange and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives. Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens and liquidity pools are created specialized for the \"rug pull\" scams, and some scam tokens have embedded tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at least $16 million from 39,762 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem, and our approach can act as a whistleblower that identifies scam tokens at their early stages.",

Architectural migration is an important activity that helps to transform the architectural styles applied during a system\u2019s design with the result of modernising the system. If not performed correctly, this process could lead to potential system failures. This article presents an automated approach to refactoring architectural design and to planning the evolution process. With our solution, the architectural design can be refactored, ensuring that system functionality is preserved. Furthermore, the architectural migration process allows the system to be safely and incrementally transformed. We have evaluated our approach with five real-world software applications. The results prove the effectiveness of our approach and identify factors that impact the performance of architectural verification and migration planning. An interesting finding is that planning algorithms generate migration plans that differ in term of their relative efficiency.",

With the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, there is expanding evidence that counterfeit cryptocurrency has also appeared. In this paper, we empirically explore the presence of counterfeit cryptocurrencies on Ethereum and measure their impact. By analyzing over 190K ERC-20 tokens (or cryptocurrencies) on Ethereum, we have identified $2,117$ counterfeit tokens that target 94 of the 100 most popular cryptocurrencies. We perform an end-to-end characterization of the counterfeit token ecosystem, including their popularity, creators and holders, fraudulent behaviors and advertising channels. Through this, we have identified two types of scams related to counterfeit tokens and devised techniques to identify such scams. We observe that over 7,104 victims were deceived in these scams, and the overall financial loss sums to a minimum of \\$ 17 million (74,271.7 ETH). Our findings demonstrate the urgency to identify counterfeit cryptocurrencies and mitigate this threat.",

        "Title": "Disentangling Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Compositions",
        "Abstract": "We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm\u2019s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, i.e., contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks and, thereby, DeFi protocols would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.",

        "Abstract": "Online advertising, also known as web advertising or Internet marketing, is the means and process of promoting products and services on the Internet, and it has been one of the important business models for the Internet. Due to its lucrative nature and its large scale of adoption, it has also been a target for malicious parties with various attack aims such as getting a cut of online advertising revenues, obtaining a user\u2019s privacy, and spreading malware. Over the years, a great deal of research has been conducted on online advertising. Recently, the health of the online advertising ecosystem has become more of a concern for both advertisers and regular Internet users. Advertising budgets have been abused, and Internet users\u2019 privacy and security have been infringed. In this article, we broadly study threats to online advertising and trace the root causes from a systems point of view. Existing threat mitigation strategies are also reviewed and analyzed. To protect online advertising, which has been an essential funding source of many free Internet services, several challenges still need to be addressed, including the need for transparency of the advertising ecosystem and software vulnerabilities on the client-side. To overcome these challenges, we conclude by brainstorming some innovative ideas on some potentially interesting and useful research directions.",

We then matched the selections with indicators of market success for the same artworks. We find that prestigious artworks selected by art experts and artists are also successful in the gallery marketplace, tracing an interesting link between prestige and success in the art context. We also observe a clear divergence between the roles of art expert and art maker (artist).",

The architecture of Webchain, a new system enabling source and reference verifiability on the Web, is combining distributed ledger technologies with secure timestamping to ensure the history of creation, ownership, and referential integrity of online resources. We present the architecture and system extensions, conduct a security analysis, and evaluate the Webchain system based on a comprehensive prototype implementation.

        "Title": "How Should We Regulate Cryptocurrencies via Consensus?: A Strategic Framework for Optimal Legal Transaction Throughput",
        "Abstract": "Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions with are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.",

        "Abstract": "Whereas part of the world can benefit from the wonders of digital technologies, undocumented migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees are facing the rough reality of being \u201cinvisible\u201d in society and ignored by governments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic impact of the closure of the service industry and the impossibility to keep most of the informal work they perform place them into a limbo without income and unemployment benefits. They are denied formal support because of the lack of a legally recognized identity. For this type of humanitarian support, contemporary identities can offer a way out. Self-sovereign identities (SSI) can provide individuals ownership over their data and the ability to share this with others. The essence is that the owner determines whom they share their identity data with. They have the sole ownership of the identity data. As such, an SSI ensures privacy for undocumented persons. This would allow to provide support to those who are left behind by a lack of formal identity. In this article, we explore the possibility of SSI to assist undocumented individuals throughout the pandemic times. SSI can be used to interact with undocumented workers and to share all kinds of identity data, such as sharing the attestation of COVID-19 tests or the ability to donate money to those who are illegal without sacrificing their identity.",

        "Abstract": "The use of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been gaining traction in recent years due to various reasons. While charging their EVs, users expose their identity and personal details, and an adversary being able to identify and track where users charge their EVs is a potential privacy threat. In this article, we propose a user-empowered privacy-preserving authentication protocol for EV charging based on Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential (VC) to provide Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-security. The proposed method gives users full control over their identities and allows them to remain anonymous while charging from any station. Giving control over their identities empowers users. At the same time, by making use of the concept of VC, other parties can verify that a user is legitimate and authenticate the user before providing charging services. Hence, the proposed protocol makes the charging service available in a secure way, while empowering users and preserving their privacy.",

        "Title": "Safe and Private Forward-trading Platform for Transactive Microgrids",
        "Abstract": "Power grids are evolving at an unprecedented pace due to the rapid growth of distributed energy resources (DER) in communities. These resources are very different from traditional power sources, as they are located closer to loads and thus can significantly reduce transmission losses and carbon emissions. However, their intermittent and variable nature often results in spikes in the overall demand on distribution system operators (DSO). To manage these challenges, there has been a surge of interest in building decentralized control schemes, where a pool of DERs combined with energy storage devices can exchange energy locally to smooth fluctuations in net demand. Building a decentralized market for transactive microgrids is challenging, because even though a decentralized system provides resilience, it also must satisfy requirements such as privacy, efficiency, safety, and security, which are often in conflict with each other. As such, existing implementations of decentralized markets often focus on resilience and safety but compromise on privacy. In this article, we describe our platform, called TRANSAX, which enables participants to trade in an energy futures market, which improves efficiency by finding feasible matches for energy trades, enabling DSOs to plan their energy needs better. TRANSAX provides privacy to participants by anonymizing their trading activity using a distributed mixing service, while also enforcing constraints that limit trading activity based on safety requirements, such as keeping planned energy flow below line capacity. We show that TRANSAX can satisfy the seemingly conflicting requirements of efficiency, safety, and privacy. We also provide an analysis of how much trading efficiency is lost. Trading efficiency is improved through the problem formulation, which accounts for temporal flexibility, and system efficiency is improved using a hybrid-solver architecture. Finally, we describe a testbed to run experiments and demonstrate its performance using simulation results.",

Two of Bitcoin\u2019s challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin\u2019s pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the \u201cmonopolistic auction\u201d [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one\u2019s value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.",

        "Title": "Toward Responsible AI: An Overview of Federated Learning for User-centered Privacy-preserving Computing",
        "Abstract": "With the rapid advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications, an increasing concern is on the development and application of responsible AI technologies. Building AI technologies or machine-learning models often requires massive amounts of data, which may include sensitive, user private information to be collected from different sites or countries. Privacy, security, and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the acquisition and integration of these data. It is thus a serious challenge to protect user privacy while achieving high-performance models. This article reviews recent progress of federated learning in addressing this challenge in the context of privacy-preserving computing. Federated learning allows global AI models to be trained and used among multiple decentralized data sources with high security and privacy guarantees, as well as sound incentive mechanisms. This article presents the background, motivations, definitions, architectures, and applications of federated learning as a new paradigm for building privacy-preserving, responsible AI ecosystems.",

Correspondingly, we propose a detecting method based on Graph Convolutional Network and autoencoder to precisely distinguish phishing accounts. Experiments on different large-scale real-world datasets from Ethereum show that our proposed model consistently performs promising results compared with related methods.",

Here, we analyse the protocol using PRISM+, an extension of the probabilistic model checker PRISM with primitives for expressing blockchain data types. First, we extend PRISM+ to include data types and operations for modelling and analysing Proof of Stake-based consensus protocols. Then, we model Hybrid Casper in PRISM+ as a parallel composition of stochastic processes, thus precisely describing the behaviour of the protocol and highlighting its corner cases. PRISM+ is therefore used to rapidly and automatically analyse the resilience of Hybrid Casper when tuning, up or down, several basic parameters of the protocol, such as the rates of creating blocks, and the strategies for determining penalties. Finally, we study the robustness of Hybrid Casper to two well known attacks: the Eclipse attack and the majority attack.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to enable a scenario where smart objects, inserted into information networks, supply smart services for human beings. The introduction of edge computing in IoT can reduce the decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and expand the cloud services to be allocated at the network\u2019s edge. However, edge-based IoT systems currently face challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management is essential to obtain reliable mining and data fusion, improved user privacy and data security, and provisioning of services with context-awareness. In this survey, we first examine the edge-based IoT architectures currently reported in the literature. Then, a complete review of trust requirements in edge-based IoT systems is produced. Also, we discuss about blockchain as a solution to solve several trust problems in IoT and analyze in detail the correlation between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of performance aspects of trusted edge-based IoT systems and recommend promising research directions.",

        "Title": "Enhancement learning on financial text data",
        "Abstract": "With the fast development of natural language processing (NLP), financial text data processing has gained much attention due to its huge potential business value. Deep learning model based on manual perception-based labeling is commonly used to illustrate implicit meanings behind financial text. However, such manual labeling is costly and subjective, and may not perform well due to its weak link with direct financial trading. This paper therefore proposes a novel learning model called Enhancement Learning (EL) on financial text data by using task-based labeling. Financial text often has its application task. The derived financial trading data from such task called task-based label is objective and links to certain characters of financial text. Compared to model trained only on manual labels, EL consists of two models trained by manual perception-based labels and derived task-based labels respectively. Then, the task-based model will be used as main model to produce initial judgment on text, with the perception-based model as a filter to drop cases which are different from common perception. This task-oriented perception-enhanced approach can improve the performance of financial text data due to its direct link with financial task and further verification from perception. This paper illustrates the proposed Enhancement Learning on financial text data by the case in stock return prediction. Numerical experiments show that EL performs better than both the perception-based model and the task-based model.",

        "Abstract": "Through the collaboration of cloud and edge, cloud-edge computing allows the edge that approximates end-users undertakes those non-computationally intensive service processing of the cloud, reducing the communication overhead and satisfying the low latency requirement of Internet of Vehicle (IoV). With cloud-edge computing, the computing tasks in IoV is able to be delivered to the edge servers (ESs) instead of the cloud and rely on the deployed services of ESs for a series of processing. Due to the storage and computing resource limits of ESs, how to dynamically deploy partial services to the edge is still a puzzle. Moreover, the decision of service deployment often requires the transmission of local service requests from ESs to the cloud, which increases the risk of privacy leakage. In this article, a method for privacy-aware IoV service deployment with federated learning in cloud-edge computing, named PSDF, is proposed. Technically, federated learning secures the distributed training of deployment decision network on each ES by the exchange and aggregation of model weights, avoiding the original data transmission. Meanwhile, homomorphic encryption is adopted for the uploaded weights before the model aggregation on the cloud. Besides, a service deployment scheme based on deep deterministic policy gradient is proposed. Eventually, the performance of PSDF is evaluated by massive experiments.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we study a canonical distributed resource allocation problem arising in blockchains. While distributed resource allocation is a well-studied problem in networking, the blockchain setting additionally requires the solution to be resilient to adversarial behavior from a fraction of nodes. Scaling blockchain performance is a basic research topic; a plethora of solutions (under the umbrella of sharding ) have been proposed in recent years. Although the various sharding solutions share a common thread (they cryptographically stitch together multiple parallel chains), architectural differences lead to differing resource allocation problems. In this paper we make three main contributions: (a) we categorize the different sharding proposals under a common architectural framework, allowing for the emergence of a new, uniformly improved, uni-consensus sharding architecture. (b) We formulate and exactly solve a core resource allocation problem in the uni-consensus sharding architecture -- our solution, Free2shard, is adversary-resistant and achieves optimal throughput. The key technical contribution is a mathematical connection to the classical work of Blackwell approachability in dynamic game theory. (c) We implement the sharding architecture atop a full-stack blockchain in 3000 lines of code in Rust -- we achieve a throughput of more than 250,000 transactions per second with 6 shards, a vast improvement over state-of-the-art.",

        "Title": "Scientific Workflows in IoT Environments: A Data Placement Strategy Based on Heterogeneous Edge-Cloud Computing",
        "Abstract": "In Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) environments, the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide a more proper solution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other traditional distributed computing. Owing to the different sizes of scientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it is essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data transmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge computing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the dynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and exiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To address this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model that includes shared datasets within the individual and among multiple workflows across various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement strategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the build-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to proper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution problem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning\u2013based approach to learn the data placement strategy in the runtime stage of scientific workflows. Through using the heterogeneous edge-cloud computing architecture to simulate IoT environments, we designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of DYM-RL-DPS. The results of our strategy can effectively reduce the data transmission time as compared to other strategies.",

        "Abstract": "The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LifeScope to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting Unmatched ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LifeScope achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.",

However, how to motivate data owners to participate in and stay within an FL ecosystem by continuously contributing their data to the FL model remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a hybrid incentive mechanism based on blockchain to address the above challenge. The proposed mechanism comprises two primary smart contract-based modules, namely the reputation module and the reverse auction module. The former is used to dynamically calculate the reputation score of each FL participant. It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed mechanism against the three typical threats. Experimental results indicate that our mechanism can successfully reduce incentive costs while preventing participants from colluding and over-bidding in the data sharing auction.",

        "Title": "LedgerDB: a centralized ledger database for universal audit and verification",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of Blockchain has attracted widespread attention. However, we observe that in practice, many applications on permissioned blockchains do not benefit from the decentralized architecture. When decentralized architecture is used but not required, system performance is often restricted, resulting in low throughput, high latency, and significant storage overhead. Hence, we propose LedgerDB on Alibaba Cloud, which is a centralized ledger database with tamper-evidence and non-repudiation features similar to blockchain, and provides strong auditability. LedgerDB has much higher throughput compared to blockchains. It offers stronger auditability by adopting a TSA two-way peg protocol, which prevents malicious behaviors from both users and service providers. LedgerDB supports verifiable data removals demanded by many real-world applications, which are able to remove obsolete records for storage saving and hide records for regulatory purpose, without compromising its verifiability. Experimental evaluation shows that LedgerDB's throughput is 80X higher than state-of-the-art permissioned blockchain (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric). Many blockchain customers (e.g., IP protection and supply chain) on Alibaba Cloud have switched to LedgerDB for its high throughput, low latency, strong auditability, and ease of use.",

        "Title": "Performance Analysis of the IOTA DAG-Based Distributed Ledger",
        "Abstract": "Distributed ledgers (DLs) provide many advantages over centralized solutions in Internet of Things projects, including but not limited to improved security, transparency, and fault tolerance. To leverage DLs at scale, their well-known limitation (i.e., performance) should be adequately analyzed and addressed. Directed acyclic graph-based DLs have been proposed to tackle the performance and scalability issues by design. The first among them, IOTA, has shown promising signs in addressing the preceding issues. IOTA is an open source DL designed for the Internet of Things. It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, to achieve a potentially higher scalability over blockchain-based DLs. However, due to the uncertainty and centralization of the deployed consensus, the current IOTA implementation exposes some performance issues, making it less performant than the initial design. In this article, we first extend an existing simulator to support realistic IOTA simulations and investigate the impact of different design parameters on IOTA\u2019s performance. Then, we propose a layered model to help the users of IOTA determine the optimal waiting time to resend the previously submitted but not yet confirmed transaction. Our findings reveal the impact of the transaction arrival rate, tip selection algorithms, weighted tip selection algorithm randomness, and network delay on the throughput. Using the proposed layered model, we shed some light on the distribution of the confirmed transactions. The distribution is leveraged to calculate the optimal time for resending an unconfirmed transaction to the DL. The performance analysis results can be used by both system designers and users to support their decision making.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain. They are executed for a monetary fee paid in gas\u2014a clear optimization target for smart contract compilers. Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds\u2014by means of an efficient SMT encoding\u2014basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.",

We use a public blockchain to play the role of traditional centralized HIT systems, such that the blockchain deals with cryptocurrency payments and acts as a trustworthy judge to resolve disputes between a worker and a requester in a decentralized setting, preventing false-reporting and free-riding. Our approach neither uses expensive cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, nor sends the worker's answers to the blockchain. Compared with prior works, our approach significantly reduces on-chain cost: it only requires O(1) on-chain storage and O(logN) smart contract computation, where N is the question number of a HIT. Additionally, our approach uses known answers or gold standards to determine the worker's answer quality. To motivate the requester to use honest known answers, the requester cannot learn the worker's answers if the answer quality does not meet the requirement. We further provide formal security definitions for our decentralized HIT and prove security of our construction.",

        "Abstract": "Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization. Moreover, we develop an application based on TokenAware to demonstrate how it facilitates malicious behavior detection.",

        "Title": "SADPonzi: Detecting and Characterizing Ponzi Schemes in Ethereum Smart Contracts",
        "Abstract": "Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes, i.e., either based on the operation codes (opcodes) of the smart contract binaries or the transaction patterns of addresses. However, state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability and high false positive rates. Moreover, machine-learning based methods are susceptible to evasion techniques, and transaction-based techniques do not work on smart contracts that have a small number of transactions. These limitations render existing methods for detecting Ponzi schemes ineffective. In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, by strictly following the definition of Ponzi schemes, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to first generate the semantic information for each feasible path in smart contracts and then identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "Static analysis of smart contracts as-deployed on the Ethereum blockchain has received much recent attention. However, high-precision analyses currently face significant challenges when dealing with the Ethereum VM (EVM) execution model. A major such challenge is the modeling of low-level, transient \u201cmemory\u201d (as opposed to persistent, on-blockchain \u201cstorage\u201d) that smart contracts employ. Statically understanding the usage patterns of memory is non-trivial, due to the dynamic allocation nature of in-memory buffers. We offer an analysis that models EVM memory, recovering high-level concepts (e.g., arrays, buffers, call arguments) via deep modeling of the flow of values. Our analysis opens the door to Ethereum static analyses with drastically increased precision. One such analysis detects the extraction of ERC20 tokens by unauthorized users. For another practical vulnerability (redundant calls, possibly used as an attack vector), our memory modeling yields analysis precision of 89%, compared to 16% for a state-of-the-art tool without precise memory modeling. Additionally, precise memory modeling enables the static computation of a contract\u2019s gas cost. This gas-cost analysis has recently been instrumental in the evaluation of the impact of the EIP-1884 repricing (in terms of gas costs) of EVM operations, leading to a reward and significant publicity from the Ethereum Foundation.",

        "Abstract": "The Solidity programming language is the most widely used language for smart contract development. Improving smart contracts\u2019 correctness, security, and performance has been the driving force for research in vulnerability detection, program analysis, and compiler techniques for Solidity. Similar to system-level languages such as C, Solidity enables the embedding of low-level code in programs, in the form of inline assembly code. Developers use inline assembly for low-level optimizations, extending the Solidity language through libraries, and using blockchain-specific opcodes only available through inline assembly. Nevertheless, inline assembly fragments are not well understood by an average developer and can introduce security threats as well as affect the optimizations that can be applied to programs by the compiler; it also significantly limits the effectiveness of source code static analyzers that operate on the Solidity level. A better understanding of how inline assembly is used in practice could in turn increase the performance, security, and support for inline assembly in Solidity. This paper presents a large-scale quantitative study of the use of inline assembly in 6.8M smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that 23% of the analyzed smart contracts contain inline assembly code, and that the use of inline assembly has become more widespread over time. We further performed a manual qualitative analysis for identifying usage patterns of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts. Our findings are intended to help practitioners understand when they should use inline assembly and guide developers of Solidity tools in prioritizing which parts of inline assembly to implement first. Finally, the insights of this study could be used to enhance the Solidity language, improve the Solidity compiler, and to open up new research directions by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for replacing inline assembly in Solidity programs when there is no real necessity to use it.",

As an effective means of defending urban safety, crime prediction plays a crucial role in patrol force allocation and public safety. However, urban crime data is a macro result of crime patterns overlapped by various irrelevant factors that cause inhomogeneous noises\u2014local outliers and irregular waves. These noises might obstruct the learning process of crime prediction models and result in a deviation of performance. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel paradigm of <underline>Du</underline>al-<underline>ro</underline>bust Enhanced Spatial-temporal Learning <underline>Net</underline>work (DuroNet), an encoder-decoder architecture that possesses an adaptive robustness for reducing the effect of outliers and waves. The robustness is mainly reflected on two aspects. One is a locality enhanced module that employs local temporal context information to smooth the deviation of outliers and dynamic spatial information to assist in understanding normal points. The other is a self-attention-based pattern representation module to weaken the effect of irregular waves by learning attentive weights. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world crime datasets before and after adding Gaussian noises. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our DuroNet over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Title": "PROLISEAN: A New Security Protocol for Programmable Matter",
        "Abstract": "The vision for programmable matter is to create a material that can be reprogrammed to have different shapes and to change its physical properties on demand. They are autonomous systems composed of a huge number of independent connected elements called particles. The connections to one another form the overall shape of the system. These particles are capable of interacting with each other and take decisions based on their environment. Beyond sensing, processing, and communication capabilities, programmable matter includes actuation and motion capabilities. It could be deployed in different domains and will constitute an intelligent component of the IoT. A lot of applications can derive from this technology, such as medical or industrial applications. However, just like any other technology, security is a huge concern. Given its distributed architecture and its processing limitations, programmable matter cannot handle the traditional security protocols and encryption algorithms. This article proposes a new security protocol optimized and dedicated for IoT programmable matter. This protocol is based on lightweight cryptography and uses the same encryption protocol as a hashing function while keeping the distributed architecture in mind. The analysis and simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method and that a supercomputer will need about 5.93 \u00d7 1025 years to decrypt the message.",

        "Title": "The Cloud-edge-based Dynamic Reconfiguration to Service Workflow for Mobile Ecommerce Environments: A QoS Prediction Perspective",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of mobile service composition meets the current needs for real-time eCommerce. However, the requirements for eCommerce, such as safety and timeliness, are becoming increasingly strict. Thus, the cloud-edge hybrid computing model has been introduced to accelerate information processing, especially in a mobile scenario. However, the mobile environment is characterized by limited resource storage and users who frequently move, and these characteristics strongly affect the reliability of service composition running in this environment. Consequently, applications are likely to fail if inappropriate services are invoked. To ensure that the composite service can operate normally, traditional dynamic reconfiguration methods tend to focus on cloud services scheduling. Unfortunately, most of these approaches cannot support timely responses to dynamic changes. In this article, the cloud-edge based dynamic reconfiguration to service workflow for mobile eCommerce environments is proposed. First, the service quality concept is extended. Specifically, the value and cost attributes of a service are considered. The value attribute is used to assess the stability of the service for some time to come, and the cost attribute is the cost of a service invocation. Second, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict the stability of services, which is related to the calculation of the value attribute. Then, in view of the limited available equipment resources, a method for calculating the cost of calling a service is introduced. Third, candidate services are selected by considering both service stability and the cost of service invocation, thus yielding a dynamic reconfiguration scheme that is more suitable for the cloud-edge environment. Finally, a series of comparative experiments were carried out, and the experimental results prove that the method proposed in this article offers higher stability, less energy consumption, and more accurate service prediction.",

        "Title": "Privacy Care: A Tangible Interaction Framework for Privacy Management",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of ubiquitous computing (UbiComp) environments has increased the risk of undesired access to individuals\u2019 physical space or their information, anytime and anywhere, raising potentially serious privacy concerns. Individuals lack awareness and control of the vulnerabilities in everyday contexts and need support and care in regulating disclosures to their physical and digital selves. Existing GUI-based solutions, however, often feel physically interruptive, socially disruptive, time-consuming and cumbersome. To address such challenges, we investigate the user interaction experience and discuss the need for more tangible and embodied interactions for effective and seamless natural privacy management in everyday UbiComp settings. We propose the Privacy Care interaction framework, which is rooted in the literature of privacy management and tangible computing. Keeping users at the center, Awareness and Control are established as the core parts of our framework. This is supported with three interrelated interaction tenets: Direct, Ready-to-Hand, and Contextual. Direct refers to intuitiveness through metaphor usage. Ready-to-Hand supports granularity, non-intrusiveness, and ad hoc management, through periphery-to-center style attention transitions. Contextual supports customization through modularity and configurability. Together, they aim to provide experience of an embodied privacy care with varied interactions that are calming and yet actively empowering. The framework provides designers of such care with a basis to refer to, to generate effective tangible tools for privacy management in everyday settings.",

        "Title": "Enabling User-centered Privacy Controls for Mobile Applications: COVID-19 Perspective",
        "Abstract": "Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people\u2019s attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people\u2019s adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users\u2019 preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users\u2019 preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development. Through our research findings, we suggest mechanisms for designing inclusive apps\u2019 privacy and security measures that can be put into practice for healthcare-related apps, so that timely adoption is made possible.",

        "Abstract": "Modern software development is increasingly dependent on components, libraries, and frameworks coming from third-party vendors or open-source suppliers and made available through a number of platforms (or forges). This way of writing software puts an emphasis on reuse and on composition, commoditizing the services that modern applications require. On the other hand, bugs and vulnerabilities in a single library living in one such ecosystem can affect, directly or by transitivity, a huge number of other libraries and applications. Currently, only product-level information on library dependencies is used to contain this kind of danger, but this knowledge often reveals itself too imprecise to lead to effective (and possibly automated) handling policies. We will discuss how fine-grained function-level dependencies can greatly improve reliability and reduce the impact of vulnerabilities on the whole software ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "IoT devices generate massive amounts of biomedical data with increased digitalization and development of the state-of-the-art automated clinical data collection systems. When combined with advanced machine learning algorithms, the big data could be useful to improve the health systems for decision-making, diagnosis, and treatment. Mental healthcare is also attracting attention, since most medical problems can be associated with mental states. Affective computing is among the emerging biomedical informatics fields for automatically monitoring a person\u2019s mental state in ambulatory environments by using physiological and physical signals. However, although affective computing applications are promising to improve our daily lives, before analyzing physiological signals, privacy issues and concerns need to be dealt with. Federated learning is a promising candidate for developing high-performance models while preserving the privacy of individuals. It is a privacy protection solution that stores model parameters instead of the data itself and abides by the data protection laws such as EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We applied federated learning to heart activity data collected with smart bands for stress-level monitoring in different events. We achieved encouraging results for using federated learning in IoT-based wearable biomedical monitoring systems by preserving the privacy of the data.",

        "Title": "Beyond Frequency: Utility Mining with Varied Item-specific Minimum Utility",
        "Abstract": "Consumer behavior plays a very important role in economics and targeted marketing. However, understanding economic consumer behavior is quite challenging, such as finding credible and reliable information on product profitability. Different from frequent pattern mining, utility-oriented mining integrates utility theory and data mining. Utility mining is a useful tool for understanding economic consumer behavior. Traditional algorithms for mining high-utility patterns (HUPs) applies a single/uniform minimum utility threshold (minutil) to obtain the set of HUPs, but in some real-life circumstances, some specific products may bring lower utilities compared with others, but their profit may offer some vital information. If minutil is set high, the patterns with low minutil are missed; if minutil is set low, the number of patterns becomes unmanageable. In this article, an efficient one-phase utility-oriented pattern mining algorithm, called HIMU, is proposed for mining HUPs with varied item-specific minimum utility. A novel tree structure called a multiple item utility set-enumeration tree (MIU-tree) and the global sorted and the conditional downward closure properties are introduced in HIMU. In addition, we extended the compact utility-list structure to keep the necessary information, and thus this one-phase HIMU model greatly reduces the computational costs and memory requirements. Moreover, two pruning strategies are then extended to enhance the performance. We conducted extensive experiments in several synthetic and real-world datasets; the results indicate that the designed one-phase HIMU algorithm can address the \u201crare item problem\u201d and has better performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of runtime, memory usage, and scalability. Furthermore, the enhanced algorithms outperform the non-optimized HIMU approach.",

In the gateway-based IoT architecture, gateways aggregate data collected by perception-layer devices and upload message packets to platforms, while platforms automatically push different categories of data to different applications. However, security in processes of data transmission via gateways, storage in platforms, access by applications is the major challenge for user privacy protection. To tackle this challenge, this article presents a secure IoT scheme based on a fine-grained multi-receive signcryption scheme to realize end-to-end secure transmission and data access control. To enhance the security of online application decryption keys, we design a distributed threshold decryption scheme based on secret-sharing. Moreover, from the provable security perspective, we demonstrate that the scheme can achieve the expected IND-CCA security and EUF-CMA security. After the performance analysis, evaluation results show that the computational performance is efficient and linearly subject to the number of messages and the number of receivers.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, due to the increase in popularity of the Internet, the problem of digital data security over the Internet is increasing at a phenomenal rate. Watermarking is used for various notable applications to secure digital data from unauthorized individuals. To achieve this, in this article, we propose a joint encryption then-compression based watermarking technique for digital document security. This technique offers a tool for confidentiality, copyright protection, and strong compression performance of the system. The proposed method involves three major steps as follows: (1) embedding of multiple watermarks through non-sub-sampled contourlet transform, redundant discrete wavelet transform, and singular value decomposition; (2) encryption and compression via SHA-256 and Lempel Ziv Welch (LZW), respectively; and (3) extraction/recovery of multiple watermarks from the possibly distorted cover image. The performance estimations are carried out on various images at different attacks, and the efficiency of the system is determined in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and normalized correlation (NC), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), number of changing pixel rate (NPCR), unified averaged changed intensity (UACI), and compression ratio (CR). Furthermore, the comparative analysis of the proposed system with similar schemes indicates its superiority to them.",

        "Abstract": "Next (or successive) point-of-interest (POI) recommendation, which aims to predict where users are likely to go next, has recently emerged as a new research focus of POI recommendation. Most of the previous studies on next POI recommendation attempted to incorporate the spatiotemporal information and sequential patterns of user check-ins into recommendation models to predict the target user's next move. However, few of the next POI recommendation approaches utilized the social influence of each user's friends. In this study, we discuss a new topic of next POI recommendation and present a deep attentive network for social-aware next POI recommendation called DAN-SNR. In particular, the DAN-SNR makes use of the self-attention mechanism instead of the architecture of recurrent neural networks to model sequential influence and social influence in a unified manner. Moreover, we design and implement two parallel channels to capture short-term user preference and long-term user preference as well as social influence, respectively. By leveraging multi-head self-attention, the DAN-SNR can model long-range dependencies between any two historical check-ins efficiently and weigh their contributions to the next destination adaptively. We also carried out a comprehensive evaluation using large-scale real-world datasets collected from two popular location-based social networks, namely, Gowalla and Brightkite. Experimental results indicate that the DAN-SNR outperforms seven competitive baseline approaches regarding recommendation performance and is highly efficient among six neural-network-based methods, four of which utilize the attention mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "With the explosive growth in the number of IoT devices, ensuring the integrity of the massive data generated by these devices has become an important issue. Due to the limitation of hardware, most past data integrity verification schemes randomly select partial data blocks and then perform integrity validation on those blocks instead of examining the entire dataset. This will result in that unsampled data blocks cannot be detected even if they are tampered with. To solve this problem, we propose a new and effective integrity auditing mechanism of sensor data based on a bilinear map accumulator. Using the proposed approach will examine all the data blocks in the dataset, not just some of the data blocks, thus, eliminating the possibility of any cloud manipulation. Compared with other schemes, our proposed solution has been proved to be highly secure for all necessary security requirements, including tag forgery, data deletion, replacement, replay, and data leakage attacks. The solution reduces the computational and storage costs of cloud storage providers and verifiers, and also supports dynamic operations for data owners to insert, delete, and update data by using a tag index table (TIT). Compared with existing schemes based on RSA accumulator, our scheme has the advantages of fast verification and witness generation and no need to map data blocks to prime numbers. The new solution supports all the characteristics of a data integrity verification scheme.",

        "Title": "A Survey of Smart Contract Formal Specification and Verification",
        "Abstract": "A smart contract is a computer program that allows users to automate their actions on the blockchain platform. Given the significance of smart contracts in supporting important activities across industry sectors including supply chain, finance, legal, and medical services, there is a strong demand for verification and validation techniques. Yet, the vast majority of smart contracts lack any kind of formal specification, which is essential for establishing their correctness. In this survey, we investigate formal models and specifications of smart contracts presented in the literature and present a systematic overview to understand the common trends. We also discuss the current approaches used in verifying such property specifications and identify gaps with the hope to recognize promising directions for future work.",

        "Abstract": "Bitcoin is the leading example of a blockchain application that facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a trusted third party. This paper considers possible attacks related to the decentralized network architecture of Bitcoin. We perform a data driven study of Bitcoin and present possible attacks based on spatial and temporal characteristics of its network. Towards that, we revisit the prior work, dedicated to the study of centralization of Bitcoin nodes over the Internet, through a fine-grained analysis of network distribution, and highlight the increasing centralization of the Bitcoin network over time. As a result, we show that Bitcoin is vulnerable to spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal, and logical partitioning attacks with an increased attack feasibility due to the network dynamics. We verify our observations through data-driven analyses and simulations, and discuss the implications of each attack on the Bitcoin network. We conclude with suggested countermeasures.",

Addressing this challenge brings up familiar questions from classical distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action, how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data. Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial. We propose the notion of a cross-chain deal, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger. We also prove that some degree of centralization is required in the semi-synchronous communication model.",

        "Abstract": "Since executing a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain costs money (measured in gas), smart contract developers spend significant effort in reducing gas usage. In this paper, we propose a new technique for reducing the gas usage of smart contracts by changing the underlying data layout. Given a smart contract P and a type-level transformation, our method automatically synthesizes a new contract P\u2032 that is functionally equivalent to P. Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation. In particular, we show that our approach is effective at automating the desired data layout transformation and that it is useful for reducing gas usage of smart contracts that use rich data structures.",

        "Title": "Federated Route Leak Detection in Inter-domain Routing with Privacy Guarantee",
        "Abstract": "In the inter-domain network, route leaks can disrupt the Internet traffic and cause large outages. The accurate detection of route leaks requires the sharing of AS business relationship information. However, the business relationship information between ASes is confidential. ASes are usually unwilling to reveal this information to the other ASes, especially their competitors. In this paper, we propose a method named FL-RLD to detect route leaks while maintaining the privacy of business relationships between ASes by using a blockchain-based federated learning framework, where ASes can collaboratively train a global detection model without directly disclosing their specific business relationships. To mitigate the lack of ground-truth validation data in route leaks, FL-RLD provides a self-validation scheme by labeling AS triples with local routing policies. We evaluate FL-RLD under a variety of datasets including imbalanced and balanced datasets, and examine different deployment strategies of FL-RLD under different topologies. According to the results, FL-RLD performs better in detecting route leaks than the single AS detection, whether the datasets are balanced or imbalanced. Additionally, the results indicate that selecting ASes with the most peers to first deploy FL-RLD brings more significant benefits in detecting route leaks than selecting ASes with the most providers and customers.",

Given the multitude of heterogeneous wireless networks, the plethora of computer and storage architectures and paradigms, and the abundance of mobile and vehicular IoT devices, true smart city experiences are only attainable through a cooperative intelligent and secure IoT framework. This article provides an extensive study on different cooperative systems and envisions a cooperative solution that supports the integration and collaboration among both centralized and distributed systems, in which intelligent AI-supported IoT devices such as smart UAVs provide support in the data collection, processing and service provisioning process. Moreover, secure and collaborative decentralized solutions such as Blockchain are considered in the service provisioning process to enable enhanced privacy and authentication features for IoT applications. As such, user-specific complex services and applications within smart city environments will be delivered and made available in a timely, secure, and efficient manner.",

        "Abstract": "Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms that restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic consent (e-consent) has the potential to solve many paper-based consent approaches. Existing approaches, however, face challenges regarding privacy and security. This literature review aims to provide an overview of privacy and security challenges and requirements proposed by papers discussing e-consent implementations, as well as the manner in which state-of-the-art solutions address them. We conducted a systematic literature search using ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed Central. We included papers providing comprehensive discussions of one or more technical aspects of e-consent systems. Thirty-one papers met our inclusion criteria. Two distinct topics were identified, the first being discussions of e-consent representations and the second being implementations of e-consent in data sharing systems. The main challenge for e-consent representations is gathering the requirements for a \u201cvalid\u201d consent. For the implementation papers, many provided some requirements but none provided a comprehensive overview. Blockchain is identified as a solution to transparency and trust issues in traditional client-server systems, but several challenges hinder it from being applied in practice. E-consent has the potential to grant data subjects control over their data. However, there is no agreed-upon set of security and privacy requirements that must be addressed by an e-consent platform. Therefore, security- and privacy-by-design techniques should be an essential part of the development lifecycle for such a platform.",

However, the theoretic analysis on the DAG consensus is an untapped venue to be explored. To this end, based on one of the most typical DAG consensuses, Tangle, we investigate the impact of network load on the performance and security of the DAG-based ledger. Considering unsteady network load, we first propose a Markov chain model to capture the behavior of DAG consensus process under dynamic load conditions. The key performance metrics, i.e., cumulative weight and confirmation delay are analysed based on the proposed model. Then, we leverage a stochastic model to analyse the probability of a successful double-spending attack in different network load regimes. The results can provide an insightful understanding of DAG consensus process, e.g., how the network load affects the confirmation delay and the probability of a successful attack. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the trade-off between security level and confirmation delay, which can act as a guidance for practical deployment of DAG-based ledgers.",

        "Title": "Interactive verification of architectural design patterns in FACTum",
        "Abstract": "Architectural design patterns (ADPs) are architectural solutions to common architectural design problems. They are an important concept in software architectures used for the design and analysis of architectures. An ADP usually constrains the design of an architecture and, in turn, guarantees some desired properties for architectures implementing it. Sometimes, however, the constraints imposed by an ADP do not lead to the claimed guarantee. Thus, applying such patterns for the design of architectures might result in architectures which do not fulfill their intended requirements. To address this problem, we propose an approach for the verification of ADPs, based on interactive theorem proving. To this end, we introduce a model for dynamic architectures and a language for the specification of ADPs over this model. Moreover, we propose a framework for the interactive verification of such specifications based on Isabelle/HOL. In addition we describe an algorithm to map a specifi cation to a corresponding Isabelle/HOL theory over our framework. To evaluate the approach, we implement it in Eclipse/EMF and use it for the verification of four ADPs: variants of the Singleton, the Publisher-Subscriber, the Blackboard pattern, and a pattern for Blockchain architectures. With our approach we complement traditional approaches for the verification of architectures, which are usually based on automatic verification techniques such as model checking.",

        "Title": "A Solicitous Approach to Smart Contract Verification",
        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are tempting targets of attacks, since they often hold and manipulate significant financial assets, are immutable after deployment, and have publicly available source code, with assets estimated in the order of millions of US Dollars being lost in the past due to vulnerabilities. Formal verification is thus a necessity, but smart contracts challenge the existing highly efficient techniques routinely applied in the symbolic verification of software, due to specificities not present in general programming languages. A common feature of existing works in this area is the attempt to reuse off-the-shelf verification tools designed for general programming languages. This reuse can lead to inefficiency and potentially unsound results, since domain translation is required. In this paper we describe a carefully crafted approach that directly models the central aspects of smart contracts natively, going from the contract to its logical representation without intermediary steps. We use the expressive and highly automatable logic of constrained Horn clauses for modeling and we instantiate our approach to the Solidity language. A tool implementing our approach, called Solicitous, was developed and integrated into the SMTChecker module of the Solidity compiler solc. We evaluated our approach on an extensive benchmark set containing 22446 real-world smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain over a 27 months period. The results show that our approach is able to establish safety of significantly more contracts than comparable, publicly available verification tools, with an order of magnitude increase in the percentage of formally verified contracts.",

        "Title": "An Effective and Lightweight Countermeasure Scheme to Multiple Network Attacks in NDN",
        "Abstract": "In Named Data Networking, cache pollution, cache poisoning and interest flooding are three popular types of attacks that can drastically degrade the network performance. However, previous methods for mitigating these attacks are not sufficiently effective or efficient. Also, they cannot simultaneously handle the three attacks, or the case that core routers or edge routers are compromised. To handle these problems, we propose an effective and lightweight countermeasure scheme. It consists of token-based router monitoring policy (TRM), hierarchical consensus-based trust management (HCT), and popularity-based probabilistic caching and caching replacement policy (PPC). In TRM, each edge router monitors and evaluates each data requester&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache pollution attack and each data provider&#x2019;s probability of launching the cache poisoning attack, and accordingly assigns, rewards and penalizes tokens to them to control their data request and data provision activities. Thus, the interest flooding attack can also be mitigated by limiting the consumption of tokens. In HCT, each core router manages its directly connected edge routers using TRM, and the core routers trust each other through adopting the concept of consensus in Blockchain. Thus, the edge and core routers executing monitoring and evaluation are trustable. PPC uses probabilistic caching and caching replacement based on the popularity of received content to further mitigate the attacks and reduce caching and data verification overhead. Results from simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme has better performance, in terms of interest satisfaction ratio and average end-to-end delay than current mechanisms.",

Prevention of fake and dishonest participants is a key issue that has spurred interest in practical applications of SIS. Unfortunately, most previous SIS schemes failed to detect and locate fake or dishonest participants. In this article, an SIS for a (k, n)-threshold without pixel expansion is presented, which can detect and locate both fake and dishonest participants. Using a screening operation, the proposed approach fuses the benefits of polynomial-based SIS, visual cryptographic scheme (VCS), and hash functions to authenticate separate participants both with and without a dealer. In addition, the proposed approach achieves lossless rebuilding of the secret image. Analyses and experiments are conducted in this study to establish the effectiveness of the presented approach.",

In this work, we construct and examine a proof-of-concept prototype of such a system of systems, which consists of heterogeneous commercial off-the-shelf components, and utilises diverse communication protocols. We recognise the inherent need for lightweight security in this context, and address it by employing a low-cost state-of-the-art security solution. Our solution is based on a novel hardware and software co-engineering paradigm, utilising well-known software-based cryptographic algorithms, in order to maximise the security potential of the hardware security primitive (a Physical Unclonable Function) that is used as a security anchor. The performance of the proposed security solution is evaluated, proving its suitability even for real-time applications. Additionally, the Dolev-Yao attacker model is considered in order to assess the resilience of our solution towards attacks against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the examined system of systems. In this way, it is confirmed that the proposed solution is able to address the emerging security challenges of the oncoming era of systems of systems.",

We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction of 1/5 of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size.",

To address these problems, we adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. We integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. We assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain consensus refers to the process of validating the network's status by guaranteeing that all blocks include the same information and have the correct values across all nodes. A cryptocurrency, often known as \"crypto,\" is digital money that uses the Proof of Work (PoW) method to establish consensus. PoW is used by popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to establish consensus, which is a time-consuming and resource-intensive procedure. Miners expend a lot of energy to perform a brute-force search for the desired hash value using a nonce that isn't helpful otherwise, in order to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. A nonce is a one-time-use value that, when appended to a block and hashed, ensures that the output of the block hash begins with the correct number of zeros. In this paper, we present machine learning-based methods that give a quicker means of establishing consensus and create a template for Proof of Work protocols that ensure similar security guarantees as Bitcoin. To forecast the nonce value from block headers properties, we utilize a mix of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Our approach minimizes the protocol's time and energy usage by quickly determining the correct nonce value while maintaining security and decentralization.",

        "Title": "Scalable byzantine fault tolerance via partial decentralization",
        "Abstract": "Byzantine consensus is a critical component in many permissioned Blockchains and distributed ledgers. We propose a new paradigm for designing BFT protocols called DQBFT that addresses three major performance and scalability challenges that plague past protocols: (i) high communication costs to reach geo-distributed agreement, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering performance, and (iii) performance degradation under varying node and network conditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2) consistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this by decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the ordering process.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that execute in blockchains such as Ethereum to manipulate digital assets. Since bugs in smart contracts may lead to substantial financial losses, there is considerable interest in formally proving their correctness. However, the specification and verification of smart contracts faces challenges that rarely arise in other application domains. Smart contracts frequently interact with unverified, potentially adversarial outside code, which substantially weakens the assumptions that formal analyses can (soundly) make. Moreover, the core functionality of smart contracts is to manipulate and transfer resources; describing this functionality concisely requires dedicated specification support. Current reasoning techniques do not fully address these challenges, being restricted in their scope or expressiveness (in particular, in the presence of re-entrant calls), and offering limited means of expressing the resource transfers a contract performs.",

        "Title": "Federated Learning for Smart Healthcare: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.",

        "Title": "Smart Contract Repair",
        "Abstract": "Smart contracts are automated or self-enforcing contracts that can be used to exchange assets without having to place trust in third parties. Many commercial transactions use smart contracts due to their potential benefits in terms of secure peer-to-peer transactions independent of external parties. Experience shows that many commonly used smart contracts are vulnerable to serious malicious attacks, which may enable attackers to steal valuable assets of involving parties. There is, therefore, a need to apply analysis and automated repair techniques to detect and repair bugs in smart contracts before being deployed. In this work, we present the first general-purpose automated smart contract repair approach that is also gas-aware. Our repair method is search-based and searches among mutations of the buggy contract. Our method also considers the gas usage of the candidate patches by leveraging our novel notion of gas dominance relationship. We have made our smart contract repair tool SCRepair available open-source, for investigation by the wider community.",

        "Abstract": "Edge networks are providing services for an increasing number of companies, and they can be used for communication between edge devices and edge gateways. However, the performance of edge devices varies greatly, and it is not easy to upgrade low-performance edge devices. Therefore, cyber attackers can use the vulnerability of edge devices to implement advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. This paper proposes a network verification framework for edge networks that can minimize the upgrades needed to strengthen edge network security. First, the communication parties use the data transmitted by the given edge network. Our method uses our proposed PacketVerifier to attach verification information to the packet after it is sent and to verify and restore the packet before it reaches the receiver. Second, due to the performance requirements of edge networks, we design a new data processing structure, namely, a sliding window double ring (SWDR), to improve the performance of strict sequential protocols in parallel validation. Finally, experimental simulations show that our parallel processing algorithm has good performance in terms of network bandwidth compared with two existing packet processing algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed packet with verification information is compatible with the existing network topology, which helps PacketVerifier establish trustworthy transmission in a zero-trust environment.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things is taking hold in our everyday life. Regrettably, the security of IoT devices is often being overlooked. Among the vast array of security issues plaguing the emerging IoT, we decide to focus on access control, as privacy, trust, and other security properties cannot be achieved without controlled access. This article classifies IoT access control solutions from the literature according to their architecture (e.g., centralized, hierarchical, federated, distributed) and examines the suitability of each one for access control purposes. Our analysis concludes that important properties such as auditability and revocation are missing from many proposals while hierarchical and federated architectures are neglected by the community. Finally, we provide an architecture-based taxonomy and future research directions: a focus on hybrid architectures, usability, flexibility, privacy, and revocation schemes in serverless authorization.",

This article presents a novel technique to recognize the characters in the number plate automatically by using connected component analysis (CCA), artificial neural network (ANN) and neural natural network (Triple N). The preprocessing steps, Sobel edge detection technique and CCA are applied to the captured image of the vehicle to obtain character images. ANN technique can be used over these images to recognize the characters of the image in bioinformatics. The preprocessing steps are used to remove the noise and to enhance the image for recognizing the characters effectively. After performing the preprocessing steps, the edge detection technique and CCA are carried out to separate the character images from the whole image which can be recognized using ANN. These text characters can be compared with database to find authentication of vehicle, identifying the owner of the vehicle, penalty bill generation, etc.",

        "Abstract": "Despite the rapid growth and advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT), there are critical challenges that need to be addressed before the full adoption of the IoT. Data privacy is one of the hurdles towards the adoption of IoT as there might be potential misuse of users\u2019 data and their identity in IoT applications. Several researchers have proposed different approaches to reduce privacy risks. However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications. Based on the classification, we highlight ongoing research efforts and limitations of the existing privacy-preservation techniques and map the existing IoT schemes with Fog-enabled IoT schemes to elaborate on the benefits and improvements that Fog-enabled IoT can bring to preserve data privacy in IoT applications. Lastly, we enumerate key research challenges and point out future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world\u2019s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.",

        "Abstract": "Live video streaming services have experienced significant growth since the emergence of social networking paradigms in recent years. In this scenario, adaptive bitrate streaming communications transmitted on web protocols provide a convenient and cost-efficient facility to serve various multimedia platforms over the Internet. In these communication models, video content is delivered optimally, possibly transcoded, edited automatically, and cached temporarily by network elements along the path. To this end, the computational capabilities of various network elements are considered as major resources to be optimized for service quality improvements. This article provides a contemporary survey of cutting-edge live video streaming studies from a computation-driven perspective. First, an overview of the global standards, system architectures, and streaming protocols is presented. Next, hierarchical computation-driven models of live video streaming are anatomized, including cloud-, edge-, and peer-to-peer-based solutions. Cutting-edge studies are then reviewed to discover the advances they have made in improving system performance in multiple areas. Finally, open challenges are presented to direct future research in this field.",

        "Abstract": "Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence (C3I) systems are increasingly used in critical civil and military domains for achieving information superiority, operational efficacy, and greater situational awareness. The critical civil and military domains include, but are not limited to battlefield, healthcare, transportation, and rescue missions. Given the sensitive nature and modernization of tactical domains, the security of C3I systems has recently become a critical concern. This is because cyber-attacks on C3I systems have catastrophic consequences including loss of human lives. Despite the increasing number of cyber-attacks on C3I systems and growing concerns about C3I systems\u2019 security, there is a paucity of a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. Therefore, in this paper, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. We have identified and reported security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. In particular, this paper has enabled us to (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems. We believe that our findings will serve as a guideline for practitioners and researchers to advance the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems.",

In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) could be utilized efficiently in a multitude of scenarios, including rescue missions and search, farming, mission-critical services, surveillance systems, and so on, owing to technical and realistic benefits such as low movement, the capacity to lengthen wireless coverage zones, and the ability to attain places unreachable to human beings. In many studies, IoD and UAV are utilized interchangeably. Besides, drones enhance the efficiency aspects of various network topologies, including delay, throughput, interconnectivity, and dependability. Nonetheless, the deployment of drone systems raises various challenges relating to the inherent unpredictability of the wireless medium, the high mobility degrees, and the battery life that could result in rapid topological changes. In this paper, the IoD is originally explained in terms of potential applications and comparative operational scenarios. Then, we classify ML in the IoD-UAV world according to its applications, including resource management, surveillance and monitoring, object detection, power control, energy management, mobility management, and security management. This research aims to supply the readers with a better understanding of (1) the fundamentals of IoD/UAV, (2) the most recent developments and breakthroughs in this field, (3) the benefits and drawbacks of existing methods, and (4) areas that need further investigation and consideration. The results suggest that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) method is the most often employed ML method in publications. According to research, most papers are on resource and mobility management. Most articles have focused on enhancing only one parameter, with the accuracy parameter receiving the most attention. Also, Python is the most commonly used language in papers, accounting for 90% of the time. Also, in 2021, it has the most papers published.",

        "Title": "Decentralized Trust Management: Risk Analysis and Trust Aggregation",
        "Abstract": "Decentralized trust management is used as a referral benchmark for assisting decision making by human or intelligence machines in open collaborative systems. During any given period of time, each participant may only interact with a few other participants. Simply relying on direct trust may frequently resort to random team formation. Thus, trust aggregation becomes critical. It can leverage decentralized trust management to learn about indirect trust of every participant based on past transaction experiences. This article presents alternative designs of decentralized trust management and their efficiency and robustness from three perspectives. First, we study the risk factors and adverse effects of six common threat models. Second, we review the representative trust aggregation models and trust metrics. Third, we present an in-depth analysis and comparison of these reference trust aggregation methods with respect to effectiveness and robustness. We show our comparative study results through formal analysis and experimental evaluation. This comprehensive study advances the understanding of adverse effects of present and future threats and the robustness of different trust metrics. It may also serve as a guideline for research and development of next-generation trust aggregation algorithms and services in the anticipation of risk factors and mischievous threats.",

To avoid disastrous outcomes that can result from bias-laden AI systems, responsible AI builds on four important characteristics: fairness, accountability, transparency, and explainability. To stimulate further research on data provenance that enables responsible AI, this study outlines existing biases and discusses possible implementations of data provenance to mitigate them. We first review biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing. We then discuss the current state of practice, the challenges it presents, and corresponding recommendations to address them. We present a summary highlighting how our recommendations can help establish data provenance and thereby mitigate biases stemming from the data's origins and pre-processing to realize responsible AI-based systems. We conclude with a research agenda suggesting further research avenues.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is playing a promising role in e-healthcare applications in the recent decades; nevertheless, security is one of the crucial challenges in the current field of study. Many healthcare devices (for instance, a sensor-augmented insulin pump and heart-rate sensor) collect a user\u2019s real-time data (such as glucose level and heart rate) and send them to the cloud for proper analysis and diagnosis of the user. However, the real-time user\u2019s data are vulnerable to various authentication attacks while sending through an insecure channel. Besides that, the attacks may further open scope for many other subsequent attacks. Existing security mechanisms concentrate on two-party mutual authentication. However, an IoT-enabled healthcare application involves multiple parties such as a patient, e-healthcare test-equipment, doctors, and cloud servers that requires multi-party authentication for secure communication. Moreover, the design and implementation of a lightweight security mechanism that fits into the resource constraint IoT-enabled healthcare devices are challenging. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight, multi-party authentication and key-establishment protocol in IoT-based e-healthcare service access network to counter the attacks in resource constraint devices. The proposed multi-party protocol has used a lattice-based cryptographic construct such as Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to acquire security, privacy, and efficiency. The study provided all-round analysis of the scheme, such as security, power consumption, and practical usage, in the following ways. The proposed scheme is tested by a formal security tool, Scyther, to testify the security properties of the protocol. In addition, security analysis for various attacks and comparison with other existing works are provided to show the robust security characteristics. Further, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using IBE cryptographic construct is provided to validate the practical usage. The power consumption of the scheme is also computed and compared with existing works to evaluate its efficiency.",

Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the gas limit of a function in smart contracts to avoid such error. However, underestimation often occurs when the contract is complex In this work, we propose V-Gas, which automatically generates inputs that maximize the gas cost and reduce underestimation. V-Gas is designed based on static analysis and feedback-directed mutational fuzz testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted control flow graph (WCFG) of functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops gas consumption guided selection and mutation strategies to generate the input that maximize the gas consumption.",

        "Abstract": "Mining pools have become dominant in today&#x2019;s bitcoin mining network, where miners can pool their powers together for reduced variance of block mining and steadier stream of potential income. Along with the continuous evolvement of mining pools are the increasingly intense competitions among them. Recent empirical studies have shown that the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one of the most common ways for competing mining pools to sabotage the rivals and earn illegitimate rewards. Existing efforts have been made on using static game models to analyze the interactions between mining pools, and derive the Nash Equilibrium and optimal attacking strategies in a one-time static context. To better understand the impact of such DDoS attacks, in this paper, we take a starkly different approach, and for the first time address the dynamics in mining pool attacks. Specifically, we start by formulating the interactive competition among mining pools as a general-sum stochastic game. Then we propose an efficient Nash learning algorithm to obtain the near optimal attacking strategy that maximizes the expected long-term utility. Our theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results both show that the proposed strategy outperforms the baseline myopic learning algorithm, which only aims at maximizing the revenue in the current time stage. These findings, together with our proposed stochastic game model and learning algorithm, are expected to provide more practical guidelines for mining pools to survive and thrive in the highly-competitive bitcoin ecosystem.",

        "Title": "Commoning for Fun and Profit: Experimental Publishing on the Decentralized Web",
        "Abstract": "The World Wide Web is dominated by big tech and seemingly endless scandals after a decade of growing distrust about the role technology and the Internet play in our society. As a result, there are calls for the creation of alternatives to the existing platforms and infrastructures. One such alternative is a decentralized web (DWeb) where users have control of their data and decisions. This paper presents a collectively-produced organizational autoethnography of the development of an emerging tool for publishing on the decentralized web and the magazine using it to contribute to the digital commons. Three key themes emerged: 1) how a commons-based understanding of boundaries supports participation in a broader ecosystem; 2) the ways commoning as a frame deepens engagement as opposed to a passive model of a digital commons platform; finally 3) the need to re-assess how a cohort lab model that structured the work feeds back into larger goals. From these findings, we reflect on how this project fits into a maturing DWeb ecosystem and what possibilities for social transformation are present in transitional forms of commons. We discuss the pressing need for CSCW and adjacent research communities to participate in the design of, and debates over, the new computing paradigms developing out of this wave of decentralized technologies.",

        "Title": "StarFL: Hybrid Federated Learning Architecture for Smart Urban Computing",
        "Abstract": "From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.",

Technological innovations, price fluctuations of raw materials, as well as tax, regulatory, and market demands are driving change and making the pharmaceutical supply chain more complex. Traditional supply chain management methods struggle to protect the pharmaceutical supply chain, maintain its integrity, enhance customer confidence, and aid regulators in tracking medicines. To develop effective measures that secure the pharmaceutical supply chain, it is important that the community is aware of the state-of-the-art capabilities available to the supply chain owners and participants. In this article, we will be presenting a survey of existing hardware-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain security schemes and their limitations. We also highlight the current challenges and point out future research directions. This survey should be of interest to government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and pharmacies, and all others involved in the provenance and authenticity of medicines and the integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain.",

        "Abstract": "Volunteer Computing is a kind of distributed computing that harnesses the aggregated spare computing resources of volunteer devices. It provides a cheaper and greener alternative computing infrastructure that can complement the dedicated, centralized, and expensive data centres. The aggregated idle computing resources of devices ranging from desktop computers to routers and smart TVs are being utilized to provide the much needed computing infrastructure for compute intensive tasks such as scientific simulations and big data analysis. However, the use of Volunteer Computing is still dominated by scientific applications and only a very small fraction of the potential volunteer nodes are participating. This article provides a comprehensive survey of Volunteer Computing, covering key technical and operational issues such as security, task distribution, resource management, and incentive models. The article also presents a taxonomy of Volunteer Computing systems, together with discussions of the characteristics of specific systems in each category. To harness the full potentials of Volunteer Computing and make it a reliable alternative computing infrastructure for general applications, we need to improve the existing techniques and device new mechanisms. Thus, this article also sheds light on important issues regarding the future research and development of Volunteer Computing systems with the aim of making them a viable alternative computing infrastructure.",

Through a Citation Network Analysis (CNA), we identified that there are currently three primary focus research areas on CA - Keystroke Dynamics; Mouse Movements; and Mobile Device Touch, as well as identify an emerging trend in more recent studies on multi-modal CA authentication which utilises the numerous sensors that are embedded in modern mobile devices. This study also highlights the current gaps in the literature such as the need for a consensus over how to evaluate the application and utility of CA, and the need to examine the feasibility of CA technologies that currently exist based on more use case studies.",

        "Title": "Federated Learning for Healthcare: Systematic Review and Architecture Proposal",
        "Abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) with electronic health records (EHR) is growing in popularity as a means to extract knowledge that can improve the decision-making process in healthcare. Such methods require training of high-quality learning models based on diverse and comprehensive datasets, which are hard to obtain due to the sensitive nature of medical data from patients. In this context, federated learning (FL) is a methodology that enables the distributed training of machine learning models with remotely hosted datasets without the need to accumulate data and, therefore, compromise it. FL is a promising solution to improve ML-based systems, better aligning them to regulatory requirements, improving trustworthiness and data sovereignty. However, many open questions must be addressed before the use of FL becomes widespread. This article aims at presenting a systematic literature review on current research about FL in the context of EHR data for healthcare applications. Our analysis highlights the main research topics, proposed solutions, case studies, and respective ML methods. Furthermore, the article discusses a general architecture for FL applied to healthcare data based on the main insights obtained from the literature review. The collected literature corpus indicates that there is extensive research on the privacy and confidentiality aspects of training data and model sharing, which is expected given the sensitive nature of medical data. Studies also explore improvements to the aggregation mechanisms required to generate the learning model from distributed contributions and case studies with different types of medical data.",

However, this field undergoes several interoperable issues, including large numbers of heterogeneous IoT gadgets, tools, software, sensing, and processing components, joining through the Internet, despite the deficiency of communication protocols and standards. Recently, various interoperable protocols, platforms, standards, and technologies are enhanced and altered according to the specifications of the applicability in industrial applications. However, there are no recent survey papers that primarily examine various interoperability issues that Industrial IoT (IIoT) faces. In this review, we investigate the conventional and recent developments of relevant state-of-the-art IIoT technologies, frameworks, and solutions for facilitating interoperability between different IIoT components. We also discuss several interoperable IIoT standards, protocols, and models for digitizing the industrial revolution.

        "Title": "\"The Most Trustworthy Coin\": How Ideological Tensions Drive Trust in Bitcoin",
        "Abstract": "Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the \"True Bitcoiner\" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally \"trustless\" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this \"True Bitcoiner\" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts.",

Cryptocurrencies are widely used by various IoT devices to undertake the main settlement and payment task in the M2M economy. However, the cryptocurrency market, which lacks effective supervision, has fluctuated wildly in the past few years. These fluctuations are breeding grounds for arbitrage in IoT data trading. Therefore, a practical cryptocurrency market supervision framework is very imperative in the process of IoT data trading to ensure that the trading is completed safely and fairly. The difficulty stems from how to combine these unlabeled daily trading data with supervision strategies to punish abnormal users, who disrupt the data trading market in IoT. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop hybrid supervision framework based on the unsupervised anomaly detection to solve this problem. The core is to design the multi-modal unsupervised anomaly detection methods on trading prices to identify malicious users. We then design a dedicated control strategy with three levels to defend against various abnormal behaviors, according to the detection results. Furthermore, to guarantee the reliability of this framework, we evaluate the detection rate, accuracy, Precision and time consumption of single-modal, multi-modal detection methods and the contrast algorithm Adaptive KDE [19]. Finally, an effective prototype framework for supervising is established. The extensive evaluations prove that our supervision framework greatly reduces IoT data trading risks and losses.",

        "Abstract": "Despite increasing awareness and research about online strategic information operations, there remain gaps in our understanding, including how information operations leverage the wider information ecosystem and take shape on and across multiple social media platforms. In this paper we use mixed methods, including digital trace ethnography, to look beyond a single social media platform to the broader information ecosystem. We aim to understand how multiple social media platforms are used, in parallel and complementary ways, to achieve the strategic goals of online information operations. We focus on a specific case study: the contested online conversation surrounding Syria Civil Defense (the White Helmets), a group of first responders that assists civilians affected by the civil war within the country. Our findings reveal a network of social media platforms from which content is produced, stored, and integrated into the Twitter conversation. We highlight specific activities that sustain the strategic narratives and attempt to influence the media agenda. And we note that underpinning these efforts is the work of resilience-building: the use of alternative (non-mainstream) platforms to counter perceived threats of 'censorship' by large, established social media platforms. We end by discussing the implications on social media platform policy.",

        "Title": "Cookie Banners and Privacy Policies: Measuring the Impact of the GDPR on the Web",
        "Abstract": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in effect since May of 2018. As one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation concerning privacy, it sparked a lot of discussion on the effect it would have on users and providers of online services in particular, due to the large amount of personal data processed in this context. Almost three years later, we are interested in revisiting this question to summarize the impact this new regulation has had on actors in the World Wide Web. Using Scopus, we obtain a vast corpus of academic work to survey studies related to changes on websites since and around the time the GDPR went into force. Our findings show that the emphasis on privacy increased w.r.t. online services, but plenty potential for improvements remains. Although online services are on average more transparent regarding data processing practices in their public data policies, a majority of these policies still either lack information required by the GDPR (e.g., contact information for users to file privacy inquiries) or do not provide this information in a user-friendly form. Additionally, we summarize that online services more often provide means for their users to opt out of data processing, but regularly obstruct convenient access to such means through unnecessarily complex and sometimes illegitimate interface design. Our survey further details that this situation contradicts the preferences expressed by users both verbally and through their actions, and researchers have proposed multiple approaches to facilitate GDPR-conform data processing without negatively impacting the user experience. Thus, we compiled reoccurring points of criticism by privacy researchers and data protection authorities into a list of four guidelines for service providers to consider.",

        "Title": "A Security Review in the UAVNet Era: Threats, Countermeasures, and Gap Analysis",
        "Abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming one of the main technological supports for commercial applications, embracing many domains ranging from human safety to the medical field, agriculture and environment, multimedia production, and even commercial delivery. This rise in popularity, however, is causing an increasing interest from criminals, making UAVs the target of new attacks. To fully characterize the current UAV cybersecurity landscape, we perform a complete literature review, digging into drone security historic facts and scientific studies on the matter, reviewing specialized articles and scientific papers focusing on cybersecurity threats and gaps in the context of small UAVs in commercial applications. Being a recent research and development area, most of the articles have been published between 2016 and 2020 as a direct consequence of the increase of security concerns and interest in the drone field. Papers in this review deal with UAV cyberthreats and related vulnerabilities, identifying flaws experimented in a lab or describing incidents detected in the field. Communication, sensors, and system misconfigurations are among the most important threat vectors, while sensor spoofing/jamming and malware DoS/control are among the most cited threats. Threat vectors permit depicting a complete overview of the topic and potential countermeasures known to date, with related gap analysis, also accounting for the recent Unmanned Aircraft System evolution toward ad hoc or cloud-based UAV networks. Countermeasures include the adoption of traditional communication encryption and standard protocols, GPS spoofing/jamming mitigation, encryption and privacy-aware implementations, and counter-malware techniques, to name the most adopted. It also emerges that often attacks are simply ported or adapted from other attacks in similar domains, while peculiar attacks still remain such as targeted physical attacks, specific UAV malware, and GPS spoofing/jamming.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous expansion of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and the increasing connectivity among the various intelligent devices or systems, the control of access and fusion in smart factory networks has significantly gained importance. However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.",

        "Title": "Skills Gaps in the Industry: Opinions of Embedded Software Practitioners",
        "Abstract": "Many practitioners in the software-intensive embedded industry often face difficulties after beginning their careers due to misalignment of the skills learned at the university with what is required in the workplace. Companies spend crucial resources to train personnel whose academic backgrounds are not only based on \u201ccomputing disciplines\u201d but also on non-computing ones. Analyzing the gap between the software industry and academia is important for three reasons: (1) for employers, hiring properly trained practitioners allows them to spend less time in training them while incorporating them more efficiently into the workforce; (2) for practitioners, knowing the most important skillset is helpful to increase their chance of employability; and (3) for academia, understanding the necessary skillset is critical to making curriculum changes. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey that yielded responses from 659 software professionals working worldwide in different roles. In this study, we only included the responses of 393 embedded software practitioners whose undergraduate degree was completed in Turkey, working in 10 countries. This article sheds light on the most important skills in the embedded software industry by presenting various cross-factor analyses. Understanding the coverage of these skills in the curriculum (mostly in Turkish universities) helps bridge the gaps, which can and should be achieved through more Industry Academia Collaborations (IACs).",

        "Title": "Dandelion: Redesigning the Bitcoin Network for Anonymity",
        "Abstract": "Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have surged in popularity over the last decade. Although Bitcoin does not claim to provide anonymity for its users, it enjoys a public perception of being a privacy preserving financial system. In reality, cryptocurrencies publish users' entire transaction histories in plaintext, albeit under a pseudonym; this is required for transaction validation. Therefore, if a user's pseudonym can be linked to their human identity, the privacy fallout can be significant. Recently, researchers have demonstrated deanonymization attacks that exploit weaknesses in the Bitcoin network's peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocols. In particular, the P2P network currently forwards content in a structured way that allows observers to deanonymize users. In this work, we redesign the P2P network from first principles with the goal of providing strong, provable anonymity guarantees. We propose a simple networking policy called Dandelion which provides quasi-optimal, network-wide anonymity, with minimal cost to the network's utility. We also discuss practical implementation challenges and propose heuristic solutions.",

The application plane supports programmers to develop numerous applications (such as networking, management, security, etc.) that can even be executed from remote locations. Northbound interface (NBI) bridges the control and application planes to execute the third-party applications business logic. Due to the software bugs in applications and existing vulnerabilities such as illegal function calling, resource exhaustion, lack of trust, and so on, NBIs are susceptible to different attacks. Based on the extensive literature review, we have identified that the researchers and academia have mainly focused on the security of the control plane, data plane, and southbound interface (SBI). NBI, in comparison, has received far less attention. In this article, the security of the least explored, but a critical component of the SDN architecture, i.e., NBI, is analyzed. The article provides a brief overview of SDN, followed by a detailed discussion on the categories of NBI, vulnerabilities of NBI, and threats posed by malicious applications to NBI. Efforts of the researchers to counter malicious applications and NBI issues are then discussed in detail. The standardization efforts for the single acceptable NBI and security requirements of SDN by Open Networking Foundation (ONF) are also presented. The article concludes with the future research directions for the security of a single acceptable NBI.",

        "Abstract": "Today\u2019s artificial intelligence still faces two major challenges. One is that, in most industries, data exists in the form of isolated islands. The other is the strengthening of data privacy and security. We propose a possible solution to these challenges: secure federated learning. Beyond the federated-learning framework first proposed by Google in 2016, we introduce a comprehensive secure federated-learning framework, which includes horizontal federated learning, vertical federated learning, and federated transfer learning. We provide definitions, architectures, and applications for the federated-learning framework, and provide a comprehensive survey of existing works on this subject. In addition, we propose building data networks among organizations based on federated mechanisms as an effective solution to allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy.",

        "Title": "Characterizing Cryptocurrency-themed Malicious Browser Extensions",
        "Abstract": "Due to the surging popularity of various cryptocurrencies in recent years, a large number of browser extensions have been developed as portals to access relevant services, such as cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets. This has stimulated a wild growth of cryptocurrency themed malicious extensions that cause heavy financial losses to the users and legitimate service providers. They have shown their capability of evading the stringent vetting processes of the extension stores, highlighting a lack of understanding of this emerging type of malware in our community. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study to identify and characterize cryptocurrency-themed malicious extensions. We monitor seven official and third-party extension distribution venues for 18 months (December 2020 to June 2022) and have collected around 3600 unique cryptocurrency-themed extensions. Leveraging a hybrid analysis, we have identified 186 malicious extensions that belong to five categories. We then characterize those extensions from various perspectives including their distribution channels, life cycles, developers, illicit behaviors, and illegal gains. Our work unveils the status quo of the cryptocurrency-themed malicious extensions and reveals their disguises and programmatic features on which detection techniques can be based. Our work serves as a warning to extension users, and an appeal to extension store operators to enact dedicated countermeasures. To facilitate future research in this area, we release our dataset of the identified malicious extensions and open-source our analyzer.",

In particular, the current mechanism for broadcasting Bitcoin transactions allows third-party observers to link transactions to the IP addresses that originated them. This lays the groundwork for low-cost, large-scale deanonymization attacks. In this work, we present \\Algopp, a first-principles defense against large-scale deanonymization attacks with near-optimal information-theoretic guarantees. Dandelion++ builds upon a recent proposal called Dandelion that exhibited similar goals. However, in this paper, we highlight some simplifying assumptions made in Dandelion, and show how they can lead to serious deanonymization attacks when violated. In contrast, Dandelion++ defends against stronger adversaries that are allowed to disobey protocol. Dandelion++ is lightweight, scalable, and completely interoperable with the existing Bitcoin network.

VEC can provide and manage computational resources closer to vehicles and end-users, providing access to services at lower latency and meeting the minimum execution requirements for each service type. This survey describes VEC\u2019s concepts and technologies; we also present an overview of existing VEC architectures, discussing them and exemplifying them through layered designs. Besides, we describe the underlying vehicular communication in supporting resource allocation mechanisms. With the intent to overview the risks, breaches, and measures in VEC, we review related security approaches and methods. Finally, we conclude this survey work with an overview and study of VEC\u2019s main challenges. Unlike other surveys in which they are focused on content caching and data offloading, this work proposes a taxonomy based on the architectures in which VEC serves as the central element. VEC supports such architectures in capturing and disseminating data and resources to offer services aimed at a smart city through their aggregation and the allocation in a secure manner.",

        "Title": "\"This Place Does What It Was Built For\": Designing Digital Institutions for Participatory Change",
        "Abstract": "Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the \"Ostrom Workshop.\" A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a \"constitutional layer\" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.",

New technologies have been proposed and existing approaches optimised to meet user, society and industry requirements. However, as the complexity and heterogeneity of the traffic that flows through the networks are continuously growing, the innovation becomes difficult to achieve in both IoT and legacy networks. This article provides an overview of IoT application domains from a traffic characteristics perspective. Specifically, it identifies several groups of major IoT application use cases and discusses the exhibited traffic characteristics, used network technologies for implementation, and their feasibility as well as challenges. We stress that a key factor in future IoT development is network technologies and the way they handle and forward network traffic. The traffic characteristics emerging from this work can serve as a basis for future design proposals to develop more efficient solutions and improve the network technologies.",

        "Title": "Research on the Influence of Artificial Intelligence Technology with web 3.0 on Accounting Education and Its Countermeasures",
        "Abstract": "With the continuous development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI technology has been widely used in various fields of social and economic life, bringing great impact to various industries. AI is a section of computer science, a new science technology that studies and develops theories, methods, and application systems used. The development of artificial intelligence technology first has a profound impact on the development of the accounting industry, which leads to the change of the demand for accounting talents. This paper takes the accounting industry as an example, discusses the application of artificial intelligence technology in accounting practice, analyzes its impact on the reform of accounting education, and finally proposes countermeasures and suggestions for accounting education to deal with technological challenges with the blended learning for increasing student retention and engagement in an E-learning environment. Blended learning gives greater flexibility which means being able to complete assignments any place and any time. It successfully improves students\u2019 experience and enhances their engagement. It uses apps, games, or measurable programs and helps to balance the classroom. Practice shows that the development of artificial intelligence technology not only has a profound and extensive impact on the accounting profession and accounting education, but also has a profound impact on engineering education and other fields. An in-depth study of the challenges of artificial intelligence technology to accounting education is also of reference and guiding significance for the reform and development of engineering education and other fields.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we share our experiences in designing and developing a suite of deep neural network\u2013(DNN) based COVID-19 case detection and recognition framework. Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level. Existing research has shown that DNN has been successful in identifying COVID-19 from radiological media such as CT scans and X-ray images, audio media such as cough sounds, optical coherence tomography to identify conjunctivitis and pink eye symptoms on the ocular surface, body temperature measurement using smartphone fingerprint sensors or thermal cameras, the use of live facial detection to identify safe social distancing practices from camera images, and face mask detection from camera images. We also investigate the utility of federated learning in diagnosis cases where private data can be trained via edge learning. These point-of-care modalities can be integrated with DNN-based RT-PCR laboratory test results to assimilate multiple modalities of COVID-19 detection and thereby provide more dimensions of diagnosis. Finally, we will present our initial test results, which are encouraging.",

This article provides a comprehensive review of various IoT device profiling methods and provides a clear taxonomy for IoT profiling techniques based on different security perspectives. We first investigate several current IoT device profiling techniques and their applications. Next, we analyzed various IoT device vulnerabilities, outlined multiple features, and provided detailed information to implement profiling algorithms\u2019 risk assessment/mitigation stage. By reviewing approaches for profiling IoT devices, we identify various state-of-the-art methods that organizations of different domains can implement to satisfy profiling needs. Furthermore, this article also discusses several machine learning and deep learning algorithms utilized for IoT device profiling.

        "Abstract": "Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to support such new applications and handle the increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches and promising research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Cloud computing is an essential technique to provide item traceability for industrial internet of things (IIoT) systems by providing item data sharing services. However, a malicious cloud server may prevent industrial participants from acquiring accurate traceability of items by providing inconsistent item data. To fix this issue, we propose Acics, an item data consistency auditing scheme in untrusted cloud services for cloud-aided IIoT systems. Acics presents two variants named S-Acics and L-Acics. S-Acics enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for each item and circularly play the auditing role. L-Acics further enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for a sampled subset of items while resisting data selection attack via a new separated storage mechanism. Finally, Acics integrates a fair payment mechanism built on smart contract to incentivize the cloud server to provide consistent item data access service for industrial participants. The experiment results show that our solution can audit item data consistency with reasonable cost.",

        "Title": "Chimp: efficient lossless floating point compression for time series databases",
        "Abstract": "Applications in diverse domains such as astronomy, economics and industrial monitoring, increasingly press the need for analyzing massive collections of time series data. The sheer size of the latter hinders our ability to efficiently store them and also yields significant storage costs. Applying general purpose compression algorithms would effectively reduce the size of the data, at the expense of introducing significant computational overhead. Time Series Management Systems that have emerged to address the challenge of handling this overwhelming amount of information, cannot suffer the ingestion rate restrictions that such compression algorithms would cause. Data points are usually encoded using faster, streaming compression approaches. However, the techniques that contemporary systems use do not fully utilize the compression potential of time series data, with implications in both storage requirements and access times. In this work, we propose a novel streaming compression algorithm, suitable for floating point time series data. We empirically establish properties exhibited by a diverse set of time series and harness these features in our proposed encodings. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach readily outperforms competing techniques, attaining compression ratios that are competitive with slower general purpose algorithms, and on average around 50% of the space required by state-of-the-art streaming approaches. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms all earlier techniques with regards to both compression and access time, offering a significantly improved trade-off between space and speed. The aforementioned benefits of our approach - in terms of all space requirements, compression time and read access - significantly improve the efficiency in which we can store and analyze time series data.",

        "Title": "A Tale of Two Entities: Contextualizing the Security of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations on the Power Grid",
        "Abstract": "With the growing market of Electric Vehicles (EV), the procurement of their charging infrastructure plays a crucial role in their adoption. Within the revolution of Internet of Things, the EV charging infrastructure is getting on board with the introduction of smart Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS), a myriad set of communication protocols, and different entities. We provide in this article an overview of this infrastructure detailing the participating entities and the communication protocols. Further, we contextualize the current deployment of EVCSs through the use of available public data. In the light of such a survey, we identify two key concerns, the lack of standardization and multiple points of failures, which renders the current deployment of EV charging infrastructure vulnerable to an array of different attacks. Moreover, we propose a novel attack scenario that exploits the unique characteristics of the EVCSs and their protocol (such as high power wattage and support for reverse power flow) to cause disturbances to the power grid. We investigate three different attack variations; sudden surge in power demand, sudden surge in power supply, and a switching attack. To support our claims, we showcase using a real-world example how an adversary can compromise an EVCS and create a traffic bottleneck by tampering with the charging schedules of EVs. Further, we perform a simulation-based study of the impact of our proposed attack variations on the WSCC 9 bus system. Our simulations show that an adversary can cause devastating effects on the power grid, which might result in blackout and cascading failure by comprising a small number of EVCSs.",

        "Title": "Access Control Mechanisms in Named Data Networks: A Comprehensive Survey",
        "Abstract": "Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN architectures that provides a clean-slate approach for Internet communication. NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content, causing different challenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this article, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security, and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the community.",

Finally, we highlight open research challenges and future directions in data protection research, especially that comprehensive protection requires more interdisciplinary research and a combination of approaches at different levels.",

        "Title": "Privacy-preserving Crowd-sensed Trust Aggregation in the User-centeric Internet of People Networks",
        "Abstract": "Today we are relying on Internet technologies for numerous services, for example, personal communication, online businesses, recruitment, and entertainment. Over these networks, people usually create content, a skillful worker profile, and provide services that are normally watched and used by other users, thus developing a social network among people termed as the Internet of People. Malicious users could also utilize such platforms for spreading unwanted content that could bring catastrophic consequences to a social network provider and the society, if not identified on time. The use of trust management over these networks plays a vital role in the success of these services. Crowd-sensing people or network users for their views about certain content or content creators could be a potential solution to assess the trustworthiness of content creators and their content. However, the human involvement in crowd-sensing would have challenges of privacy preservation and preventing intentional assignment of the fake high score given to certain user/content. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel trust model that evaluates the aggregate trustworthiness of the content creator and the content without compromising the privacy of the participating people in a crowdsource group. The proposed system has inherent properties of privacy protection of participants, performs operations in the decentralized setup, and considers the trust weights of participants in a private and secure way. The system ensures privacy of participants under the malicious and honest-but-curious adversarial models. We evaluated the performance of the system by developing a prototype and applying it to different real data from different online social networks.",

        "Abstract": "With the continuous increment of city volume and size, a number of traffic-related urban units (e.g., vehicles, roads, buildings, etc.) are emerging rapidly, which plays a heavy burden on the scientific traffic control of smart cities. In this situation, it is becoming a necessity to utilize the sensor data from massive cameras deployed at city crossings for accurate traffic flow prediction. However, the traffic sensor data are often distributed and stored by different organizations or parties with zero trust, which impedes the multi-party sensor data sharing significantly due to privacy concerns. Therefore, it requires challenging efforts to balance the tradeoff between data sharing and data privacy to enable cross-organization traffic data fusion and prediction. In light of this challenge, we put forward an accurate LSH (locality-sensitive hashing)-based traffic flow prediction approach with the ability to protect privacy. Finally, through a series of experiments deployed on a real-world traffic dataset, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in terms of prediction accuracy and efficiency while guaranteeing sensor data privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Smart city infrastructures such as transportation and energy networks are evolving into so-called cyber physical social systems (CPSSs), which collect and leverage citizens\u2019 data in order to adapt services to citizens\u2019 needs. The privacy implications of such systems are, however, significant and need to be addressed. Current systems either try to escape the privacy challenge via anonymization or use very rigid, hard-coded workflows that have been agreed with a data protection authority. In the case of the latter, there is a severe impact on data quality and richness, whereas in the former, only these hard-coded flows are permitted resulting in diminished functionality and potential. We address these limitations via user modeling in terms of investigating how to model and semantically represent user consent, preferences, and data usage policies that will guide the processing of said data in the data lake. Data protection is a horizontal field and consequently very wide. Therefore, we focus on a concrete setting where we extend the domain-agnostic SPECIAL policy language for a smart mobility use case supplied by Vienna\u2019s largest utility provider. To that end, (1) we create an extension of SPECIAL in terms of a core CPSS vocabulary that lowers the semantic gap between the domain agnostic terms of SPECIAL and the vocabulary of the use case; (2) we propose a workflow that supports defining domain-specific vocabularies for complex CPSSs; and (3) show that these two contributions allow successfully achieving the goals of our setting.",

We present a \u201cTrustworthy Container Repository\u201d (TCR) system which provides security assurances (confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity) regarding such a repository in a scalable manner. Trust within the TCR architecture is rooted in a low-complexity, tamper-resistant trusted module, which leverages index-ordered Merkle trees (IOMTs) to efficiently track a large number of container images and provide assurances of repository integrity to its users. The key contributions of the study are, identification of the required security model, a novel TCR data-structure, and verifiable algorithms to operate on it. Through experiment, we observe closely logarithmic time complexity of the proposed system up to a high container count (N = 225 \u2248 107).",

In this paper, we consider a cognitive dynamic network architecture CDNA where primary users PUs are rewarded for sharing their connectivities and acting as access points for secondary users SUs. CDNA creates opportunities for capacity increase by network-wide harvesting of unused data plans and spectrum from different operators. Different policies for data and spectrum trading are presented based on centralized, hybrid, and distributed schemes involving primary operator PO, secondary operator SO, and their respective end users. In these schemes, PO and SO progressively delegate trading to their end users and adopt more flexible cooperation agreements to reduce computational time and track available resources dynamically. A novel matching-with-pricing algorithm is presented to enable self-organized SU-PU associations, channel allocation and pricing for data and spectrum with low computational complexity. Since connectivity is provided by the actual users, the success of the underlying collaborative market relies on the trustworthiness of the connections. A behavioral-based access control mechanism is developed to incentivize/penalize honest/dishonest behavior and create a trusted collaborative network. Numerical results show that the computational time of the hybrid scheme is one order of magnitude faster than the benchmark centralized scheme and that the matching algorithm reconfigures the network up to three orders of magnitude faster than in the centralized scheme.",

        "Title": "Network Resilience Assessment via QoS Degradation Metrics: An Algorithmic Approach",
        "Abstract": "This paper focuses on network resilience to perturbation of edge weight. Other than connectivity, many network applications nowadays rely upon some measure of network distance between a pair of connected nodes. In these systems, a metric related to network functionality is associated to each edge. A pair of nodes only being functional if the weighted, shortest-path distance between the pair is below a given threshold T. Consequently, a natural question is on which degree the change of edge weights can damage the network functionality? With this motivation, we study a new problem, Quality of Service Degradation : given a set of pairs, find a minimum budget to increase the edge weights which ensures the distance between each pair exceeds T . We introduce four algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees for this problem. Each of them has its own strength in trade-off between effectiveness and running time, which are illustrated both in theory and comprehensive experimental evaluation.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents Scalar DL, a Byzantine fault detection (BFD) middleware for transactional database systems. Scalar DL manages two separately administered database replicas in a database system and can detect Byzantine faults in the database system as long as either replica is honest (not faulty). Unlike previous BFD works, Scalar DL executes non-conflicting transactions in parallel while preserving a correctness guarantee. Moreover, Scalar DL is database-agnostic middleware so that it achieves the detection capability in a database system without either modifying the databases or using database-specific mechanisms. Experimental results with YCSB and TPC-C show that Scalar DL outperforms a state-of-the-art BFD system by 3.5 to 10.6 times in throughput and works effectively on multiple database implementations. We also show that Scalar DL achieves near-linear (91%) scalability when the number of nodes composing each replica increases.",

        "Title": "Monetizing Spare Bandwidth: The Case of Distributed VPNs",
        "Abstract": "Residential Internet speeds have been rapidly increasing, reaching averages of ~100 Mbps in most developed countries. Several studies have shown that users have way more bandwidth than they need, only using about 20-30% on a regular day. Several systems exploit this trend by enabling users to monetize their spare bandwidth, e.g., by sharing their WiFi connection or by participating in distributed proxy or VPN (dVPN) services. Despite the proliferation of such systems, little is known on how such marketplaces operate, what are the key factors that determine the price of the spare bandwidth, and how such prices differ worldwide. In this work, we shed some light on this topic using dVPNs as a use-case. We start by formalizing the problem of bandwidth monetization as an optimization between a buyer's cost and seller's income. Next, we explore three popular dVPNs (Mysterium, Sentinel, and Tachyon) using both active and passive measurements. We find that dVPNs have a large and growing footprint, and offer comparable performance to their centralized counterpart. We identify Mysterium (in the US) as the most concrete realization of a bandwidth marketplace, for which we derive a value of spare Internet bandwidth ranging between 11 and 14 cents per GB. We also show that both buyers and sellers utilize ad-hoc \"rules-of-thumb\" when choosing their prices, which results in a sub-optimal marketplace. By applying our optimization, a seller's income can be tripled by setting a price lower than the default one which allows to attract more buyers. These observations motivate us to create RING, a first and concrete system which helps sellers to automatically adjust their prices and traffic volumes across multiple marketplaces.",

        "Abstract": "The role of wearable technology in our daily lives is rapidly growing and many users are cumulatively becoming dependent on it. To provide insight into the future of wearable technologies and various community attitudes towards them, we implemented an in-depth quantitative investigation of opinions from academic texts (DBLP and PubMed), social media (Twitter), news media (Google News and Bing News), and entrepreneurship communities (Kickstarter and Indiegogo) over a 10-year period. Our results indicate that unlike academia, the news media, entrepreneurship communities, and social media all hold overall positive attitudes towards wearable technologies. Secondly, there are diverse perspectives towards various wearable products across different platforms. Specifically, \"XR\" technologies received the most attention, while \"Exoskeleton\" ignited the most heated debates. Thirdly, we discovered that the lifetime of a hyped wearable technology lasts approximately three years. Furthermore, the news media and entrepreneurship community's attitudes towards wearable technologies did not have a strong impact on public opinion. Finally, among all types of wearable technologies, \"fashion design\" and \"healthcare\" products were the most enlightening for the market.",

        "Title": "Consent Verification Monitoring",
        "Abstract": "Advances in personalization of digital services are driven by low-cost data collection and processing, in addition to the wide variety of third-party frameworks for authentication, storage, and marketing. New privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), increasingly require organizations to explicitly state their data practices in privacy policies. When data practices change, a new version of the policy is released. This can occur a few times a year, when data collection or processing requirements are rapidly changing. Consent evolution raises specific challenges to ensuring GDPR compliance. We propose a formal consent framework to support organizations, data users and data subjects in their understanding of policy evolution under a consent regime that supports both the retroactive and non-retroactive granting and withdrawal of consent. The contributions include: (i) a formal framework to reason about data collection and access under multiple consent granting and revocation scenarios; (ii) a scripting language that implements the consent framework for encoding and executing different scenarios; (iii) five consent evolution use cases that illustrate how organizations would evolve their policies using this framework; and (iv) a scalability evaluation of the reasoning framework. The framework models are used to verify when user consent prevents or detects unauthorized data collection and access. The framework can be integrated into a runtime architecture to monitor policy violations as data practices evolve in real-time. The framework was evaluated using the five use cases and a simulation to measure the framework scalability. The simulation results show that the approach is computationally scalable for use in runtime consent monitoring under a standard model of data collection and access, and practice and policy evolution.",

        "Abstract": "The microgrid (MG) is a complicated cyber-physical system that operates based on interactions between physical processes and computational components, which make it vulnerable to varied cyber-attacks. In this paper, the impact of data integrity attack (DIA) has been considered, as one of the most dangerous cyber threats to MGs, on the steady-state operation of hybrid MGs (HMGs). Additionally, a novel method based on sequential hypothesis testing (SHT) approach, is proposed to detect DIA on the renewable energy sources\u2019 metering infrastructure and improve the data security within the HMGs. The proposed method generates a binary sample, which is used to compute a test statistic that is further used against two thresholds to decide among three alternatives. The performance of the suggested method is examined using an IEEE standard test system. The results illustrated the acceptable performance of the proposed methodology in detection of DIAs. Also, to evaluate the effect of DIA on the operation of the HMGs, DIAs with different severities are launched on the measured power generation of renewable energy resources (RESs) like wind turbine (WT). The results of this part showed that a successful DIA on renewable units can severely affect the operation of electric grids and cause serious damages.",

In this article, we revise the concepts regarding edge intelligence, such as cloud, edge, and fog computing, the motivation to use edge intelligence, and compare current approaches and analyze application scenarios. To provide a complete review of this technology, previous frameworks and platforms for edge computing have been discussed in this work to provide the general view of the basis for Edge AI. Similarly, the emerging techniques to deploy deep learning models at the network edge, as well as specialized platforms and frameworks to do so, are review in this article. These devices, techniques, and frameworks are analyzed based on relevant criteria at the network edge, such as latency, energy consumption, and accuracy of the models, to determine the current state of the art as well as current limitations of the proposed technologies. Because of this, it is possible to understand the current possibilities to efficiently deploy state-of-the-art deep learning models at the network edge based on technologies such as artificial intelligence accelerators, tensor processing units, and techniques that include federated learning and gossip training. Finally, the challenges of Edge AI are discussed in the work, as well as the future directions that can be extracted from the evolution of the edge computing and Internet of Things approaches.",

        "Abstract": "Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.",

        "Abstract": "Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document, but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using 1) the evolving focus time of news articles, 2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With semi-supervised learning and lexicon expansion, the result of the developed model can achieve 89%. The method performed better than previous baselines and traditional machine learning models with improvements of 12.65% and 4.7%, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "The introduction of software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a new network paradigm for network innovations. By decoupling the control plane from the data plane in traditional networks, SDN provides high programmability to control and manage networks. However, the communication between the two planes can be a bottleneck of the whole network. SDN-aimed DoS attacks can cause long packet delay and high packet loss rate by using massive table-miss packets to jam links between the two planes. To detect and mitigate SDN-aimed DoS attacks, this paper presents FloodDefender, an efficient and protocol-independent defense framework for SDN/OpenFlow networks. FloodDefender stands between the controller platform and other controller apps, and conforms to the OpenFlow policy without additional devices. The detection module in FloodDefender utilizes new frequency features to precisely identify SDN-aimed DoS attacks. The mitigation module uses three new techniques to efficiently mitigate attack traffic: table-miss engineering to prevent the communication bandwidth from being exhausted; packet filter to filter out attack traffic and save computational resources of the control plane; and flow rule management to eliminate most of useless flow entries in the switch flow table. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of FloodDefender shows that the defense framework can precisely identify and efficiently mitigate the SDN-aimed DoS attacks with very little overhead.",

        "Title": "Integrating Citizen Experiences in Cultural Heritage Archives: Requirements, State of the Art, and Challenges",
        "Abstract": "Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors\u2019 experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people\u2019s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.",

        "Abstract": "Ransomware remains an alarming threat in the 21st century. It has evolved from being a simple scare tactic into a complex malware capable of evasion. Formerly, end-users were targeted via mass infection campaigns. Nevertheless, in recent years, the attackers have focused on targeted attacks, since the latter are profitable and can induce severe damage. A vast number of detection mechanisms have been proposed in the literature. We provide a systematic review of ransomware countermeasures starting from its deployment on the victim machine until the ransom payment via cryptocurrency. We define four stages of this malware attack: Delivery, Deployment, Destruction, and Dealing. Then, we assign the corresponding countermeasures for each phase of the attack and cluster them by the techniques used. Finally, we propose a roadmap for researchers to fill the gaps found in the literature in ransomware\u2019s battle.",

        "Abstract": "With the widespread growth of digital information and improved internet technologies, the demand for improved information security techniques has significantly increased due to privacy leakage, identity theft, illegal copying, and data distribution. Because of this, data hiding approaches have received much attention in several application areas. However, those approaches are unable to solve many issues that are necessary to measure in future investigations. This survey provides a comprehensive survey on data hiding techniques and their new trends for solving new challenges in real-world applications. The notable applications are telemedicine, 3D objects, mobile devices, cloud/distributed computing and data mining environments, chip and hardware protection, cyber physical systems, internet traffic, fusion of watermarking and encryption, joint compression and watermarking, biometric watermarking, watermarking at the physical layer, and many other perspectives. Further, the potential issues that existing approaches of data hiding face are identified. I believe that this survey will provide a valuable source of information for finding research directions for fledgling researchers and developers.",

        "Abstract": "Air pollution is a serious global issue impacting public health and social economy. In particular, exposure to small particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) can cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and cancer. Fine-grained urban air quality monitoring is crucial yet difficult to achieve. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an ambient environment aware system, namely UbiAir, which can support fine-grained urban air quality monitoring through mobile crowdsensing on a bike-sharing system. We have built specific IoT box configured with multiple pollutant sensors and attached on shared bikes to sample micro-scale air quality data in the monitoring space that is split by a scalable grid structure. Both hardware and software data calibration methods are exploited in UbiAir to make the sampled data reliable. Then, we use Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) as an inference model that leverages the calibrated samples to recover data points without direct measurements and reconstruct an accurate air quality map covering the entire monitoring space. In addition, red envelope based incentive schemes and differential rewarding strategies have been designed in UbiAir, and an adaptive BCS algorithm is proposed to deploy the red envelopes at the most informative positions to facilitate data sampling and inference. We have tested our system on campus with over 100k data measurements collected by 36 students through 18 days. Our real-world experiments show that UbiAir is a light-weight, low-cost, accurate and scalable system for fine-grained air quality monitoring, as compared with other solutions.",

In recent years, an image compression scheme has been widely considered; such a scheme saves on hardware storage space and lowers both the transmission time and bandwidth demand for various potential applications. In this article, we review the various approaches taken to consider joint encryption and compression, assessing both their merits and their limitations. In addition to the survey, we also briefly introduce the most interesting and most often utilized applications of image encryption and evaluation metrics, providing an overview of the various kinds of image encryption schemes available. The contribution made by these approaches is then summarized and compared, offering a consideration of the different technical perspectives. Lastly, we highlight the recent challenges and some potential research directions that could fill the gaps in these domains for both researchers and developers.",

        "Abstract": "Responding to NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's call to double the number of students graduating with a Bachelors degrees in computer science, in 2017, the Tech-in-Residence Corps (TIRC) program, first-of-its-kind multi stakeholder partnership between academia, government, and private industry, was established at the City University of New York. The TIRC program quickly led to a rethinking of the potential roles that industry adjuncts can take on within CS Departments. Its driving hypothesis was that by employing a coordinated campaign to recruit top-quality industry practitioners to not only teach students advanced applied topics directly, but also provide feedback on curriculum development, this would enable campus departments to align better with industry practices. In addition, industry adjuncts explored opportunities within their companies for student internships and full-time entry-level jobs, with the hope that this would increase students' job competitiveness. Ultimately, this created a sustained feedback loop that lead to other mutually beneficial arrangements between the tech industry and the university's CS Departments. This panel discussion will represent the different perspectives of various stakeholders who have directly participated in the Tech-in-Residence Corps program: department faculty, an industry adjunct, the TIRC program manager, and a university administrator.",

        "Abstract": "Digital Government refers to the use of information technology to support government operations, engage citizens, and provide government services, as the Digital Government Society declares in its mission statement. While modern information technologies provide the necessary underpinnings expressed by the terms \u201cdigital\u201d or the outdated \u201celectronic,\u201d for this public-sector phenomenon, technology in and by itself is not sufficient to capture the scope and various dimensions of Digital Government, which, unobserved at first, and later even disputed, continue to have increasingly transformational influences on the business of government in all its aspects, on all levels, and in all branches. In this disquisition, the evolution of Digital Government is portrayed and discussed from its humble beginnings to the intermediary present along with a projection and a preview of where this fascinating multidisciplinary domain of research and practice might lead in the next two decades. It is claimed that the transformation of the business of government is just beginning, and it is argued that major and undeniable instances of transition can be observed in the next decade.",

        "Abstract": "The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is designed to refine and optimize the process controls, thereby leveraging improvements in economic benefits, such as efficiency and productivity. However, the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in an IIoT environment has problems such as low security and high cost. To overcome such issues, a mutual authentication scheme that is suitable for RFID systems, wherein techniques in Deep Learning (DL) are incorporated onto the Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (APUF) for the secured access authentication of the IC circuits on the IoT, is proposed. The design applies the APUF-MPUF mutual authentication structure obtained by DL to generate essential real-time authentication information, thereby taking advantage of the feature that the tag in the PUF circuit structure does not need to store any essential information and resolving the problem of key storage. The proposed scheme also uses a bitwise comparison method, which hides the PUF response information and effectively reduces the resource overhead of the system during the verification process, to verify the correctness of the two strings. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has high robustness and security against different conventional attack methods, and the storage and communication costs are 95.7% and 42.0% lower than the existing schemes, respectively.",

        "Title": "Edge Computing with Artificial Intelligence: A Machine Learning Perspective",
        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the widespread popularity of Internet of things (IoT). By providing sufficient data for model training and inference, IoT has promoted the development of artificial intelligence (AI) to a great extent. Under this background and trend, the traditional cloud computing model may nevertheless encounter many problems in independently tackling the massive data generated by IoT and meeting corresponding practical needs. In response, a new computing model called edge computing (EC) has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. With the continuous deepening of the research on EC, however, scholars have found that traditional (non-AI) methods have their limitations in enhancing the performance of EC. Seeing the successful application of AI in various fields, EC researchers start to set their sights on AI, especially from a perspective of machine learning (ML), a branch of AI which has gained increased popularity in the past decades. In this paper, we first explain the formal definition of EC and the reasons why EC has become a favorable computing model. Then, we discuss the problems of interest in EC. We summarize the traditional solutions and hightlight their limitations. By explaining the research results of using AI to optimize EC and applying AI to other fields under the EC architecture, this paper can serve as a guide to explore new research ideas in these two aspects while enjoying the mutually beneficial relationship between AI and EC.",

        "Abstract": "Nature-inspired optimization is one of the most prevalent research domains with a confounding history that fascinates the research communities. Particle Swarm Optimization is one of the well-known optimizers that belongs to the family of nature-inspired algorithms. It often suffers from premature convergence leading to a local optimum. To address this, several methods were presented using different network topologies of the particles, but either lacked accuracy or were slow. To solve these problems, an improved version of the Directed Weighted Complex Network Particle Swarm Optimization using the Genetic Algorithm (GDWCN-PSO) is presented. This method uses the concept of the Genetic Algorithm after each update to enhance convergence and diversity. Since most of the real-world applications and complex optimization problems involve more than one objective function so to suit this problem, a multiobjective version of GDWCN-PSO is also proposed and validated on standard benchmarks. To demonstrate its applicability in real-world applications, GDWCN-PSO is applied to solve the optimal key-based medical image encryption. It is one of the most challenging problems in health IoTs for protecting sensitive and confidential patient data as well as addressing the major concern of integrity and security of data in today\u2019s advanced digital world.",

They facilitate the communication and computing resource allocation to guarantee low delay and energy consumption demands in healthcare. This article presents an improved offloading algorithm for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) based on Deep Q Network (DQN) and Simulated Annealing (SA) for IoB. Firstly, we analyze the network model and establish a task cost function based on processing delay and energy consumption. Secondly, we define a Distributed Optimization Problem (DOP) to maximize individual utilities and system utility, which is proved to be a potential countermeasure. Thirdly, we conduct Markov modeling for the current offloading strategy-making scheme and define the objectives and constraints of the optimization function. At the same time, the SA is introduced into the DQN Algorithm, which improves the capacity of the algorithm by focusing on the exploration in the early stage and following the experience value in the later stage. From the simulation results, we can see that compared with the traditional scheme, the proposed strategy can maximize the utilization of the system and reduce processing delay and energy consumption.",

        "Title": "The Invisible Side of Certificate Transparency: Exploring the Reliability of Monitors in the Wild",
        "Abstract": "To detect fraudulent TLS server certificates and improve the accountability of certification authorities (CAs), certificate transparency (CT) is proposed to record certificates in publicly-visible logs, from which the monitors fetch all certificates and watch for suspicious ones. However, if the monitors, either domain owners themselves or third-party services, fail to return a complete set of certificates issued for a domain of interest, potentially fraudulent certificates may not be detected and then the CT framework becomes less reliable. This paper presents the first systematic study on CT monitors. We analyze the data in 88 public logs and the services of 5 active third-party monitors regarding 3,000,431 certificates of 6,000 selected Alexa Top-1M websites. We find that although CT allows ordinary domain owners to act as monitors, it is impractical for them to perform reliable processing by themselves, due to the rapidly increasing volume of certificates in public logs (e.g., on average about 5 million records or 28.29 GB daily for the minimal set of logs that need to be monitored in 2018, or more than 7 million records per day in 2020, according to the Chrome CT policy). Moreover, our study discloses that (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${a}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) none of the third-party monitors guarantees to return the complete set of certificates for a domain, and (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${b}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) for some domains, even the union of the certificates returned by the five third-party monitors can probably be incomplete. As a result, the certificates accepted by CT-enabled browsers are not actually visible to the claimed domain owners, even when CT is adopted with well-functioning logs. The risk of invisible fraudulent certificates in public logs raises doubts on the reliability of CT in practice.",

        "Abstract": "This paper introduces and describes a novel architecture scenario based on Cloud Computing and counts on the innovative model of Federated Learning. The proposed model is named Integrated Federated Model, with the acronym InFeMo. InFeMo incorporates all the existing Cloud models with a federated learning scenario, as well as other related technologies that may have integrated use with each other, offering a novel integrated scenario. In addition to this, the proposed model is motivated to deliver a more energy efficient system architecture and environment for the users, which aims to the scope of data management. Also, by applying the InFeMo the user would have less waiting time in every procedure queue. The proposed system was built on the resources made available by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and by using the PaaS (Platform as a Service) model, in order to be able to handle user requests better and faster. This research tries to fill a scientific gap in the field of federated Cloud systems. Thus, taking advantage of the existing scenarios of FedAvg and CO-OP, we were keen to end up with a new federated scenario that merges these two algorithms, and aiming for a more efficient model that is able to select, depending on the occasion, if it \u201ctrains\u201d the model locally in client or globally in server.",

        "Title": "An Intelligent Mechanism to Automatically Discover Emerging Technology Trends: Exploring Regulatory Technology",
        "Abstract": "Technology trend analysis uses data relevant to historical performance and extrapolates it to estimate and assess the future potential of technology. Such analysis is used to analyze emerging technologies or predict the growing markets that influence the resulting social or economic development to assist in effective decision-making. Traditional trend analysis methods are time-consuming and require considerable labor. Moreover, the implemented processes may largely rely on the specific knowledge of the domain experts. With the advancement in the areas of science and technology, emerging cross-domain trends have received growing attention for its considerable influence on society and the economy. Consequently, emerging cross-domain predictions that combine or complement various technologies or integrate with diverse disciplines may be more critical than other tools and applications in the same domain. This study uses a design science research methodology, a text mining technique, and social network analysis (SNA) to analyze the development trends concerning the presentation of the product or service information on a company's website. This study applies regulatory technology (RegTech) as a case to analyze and justify the emerging cross-disciplinary trend. Furthermore, an experimental study is conducted using the Google search engine to verify and validate the proposed research mechanism at the end of this study. The study results reveal that, compared with Google Trends and Google Correlate, the research mechanism proposed in this study is more illustrative, feasible, and promising because it reduces noise and avoids the additional time and effort required to perform a further in-depth exploration to obtain the information.",

        "Abstract": "Data provenance tools aim to facilitate reproducible data science and auditable data analyses, by tracking the processes and inputs responsible for each result of an analysis. Fine-grained provenance further enables sophisticated reasoning about why individual output results appear or fail to appear. However, for reproducibility and auditing, we need a provenance archival system that is tamper-resistant, and efficiently stores provenance for computations computed over time (i.e., it compresses repeated results). We study this problem, developing solutions for storing fine-grained provenance in relational storage systems while both compressing and protecting it via cryptographic hashes. We experimentally validate our proposed solutions using both scientific and OLAP workloads.",

        "Title": "Desynchronization Attacks Resilient Watermarking Method Based on Frequency Singular Value Coefficient Modification",
        "Abstract": "Desynchronization is a very challenging type of attack in audio watermarking. The traditional singular value decomposition (SVD) based audio watermarking methods embed the watermark information by modifying the singular value of individual segment, which have little resistance against desynchronization attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency singular value coefficient (FSVC) feature, which reflects the ratio between the singular values of two consecutive segments and is insensitive to desynchronization attacks, to carry the watermark bits. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that the ratio between singular values is employed for audio watermarking. In the proposed method, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is performed on two consecutive segments of the host audio signal and SVD is applied to the DCT coefficients of the mid frequency band of each segment to extract the FSVC. Then the watermark bits are embedded by adjusting the values of the FSVC. The watermark embedding procedure is optimized to minimize the perceptual quality degradation and an error buffer is created to enhance the robustness. As a result, the proposed method can achieve a much higher embedding capacity than the existing methods tackling desynchronization attacks. The impact of desynchronization and common signal processing attacks on the proposed watermarking method is mathematically modeled, and the effectiveness of the proposed method against these attacks is theoretically and experimentally validated.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices are becoming integrated into a significant and increasing proportion of critical infrastructures, changing the cybersecurity-risk landscape. Risk is being introduced to industry sectors such as transport, energy, and manufacturing, with new attack surfaces exposed and potential for increased harm. Furthermore, risk and harm arising in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) could propagate across interconnected organisations and sectors, resulting in systemic risk. Aspects of this changing risk landscape are not addressed by current cybersecurity approaches, leaving cybersecurity-capability gaps. In this article, we show how current and emerging cybersecurity needs in the IIoT align with a key industry cybersecurity standard, the NIST Cyber Security Framework. The key capability gaps emerging in the IIoT are identified based on our findings from a series of workshops with over 100 expert participants. We present a comprehensive research agenda to enable researchers to prioritise research focus to address these gaps; this research agenda covers the full lifecycle of IIoT development (design, implementation, use and decommission). Furthermore, we conclude that there is a significant gap in understanding of the nature of systemic risk, which should be a key priority if we are to develop effective solutions for cybersecurity and safety in IIoT environments.",

        "Title": "A Generic Secure Transmission Scheme Based on Random Linear Network Coding",
        "Abstract": "Unlike general routing strategies, network coding (NC) can combine encoding functions with multi-path propagation over a network. This allows network capacity to be achieved to support complex security solutions. Moreover, NC has intrinsic security advantages against passive attacks over traditional routing techniques. However, due to the transmission of the global encoding kernels, the system is fragile to eavesdropping attacks with multiple probes. This paper proposes a generic unicast secure transmission scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). Specifically, the intended receiver generates a random matrix upon receiving the request from the source node, and then transmits each row vector of this matrix over a link reversely to the source node. Each intermediate node rearranges all received vectors to form a matrix by row, and then post-multiplies its local encoding kernel by this matrix to obtain a new matrix. Similarly, each row vector of the new matrix is reversely transmitted over a link to the source node. This procedure is performed until we have the source node, where the generalized inverse of the received matrix (or part of it) can be used as its local encoding kernel. Hence, the intended receiver can use the generated matrix (or the corresponding part) to decode the received data packets directly. We also analyze the security to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is at least as secure as other methods against wiretapping attacks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its utility.",

        "Abstract": "Unlike general routing strategies, network coding (NC) can combine encoding functions with multi-path propagation over a network. This allows network capacity to be achieved to support complex security solutions. Moreover, NC has intrinsic security advantages against passive attacks over traditional routing techniques. However, due to the transmission of the global encoding kernels, the system is fragile to eavesdropping attacks with multiple probes. This paper proposes a generic unicast secure transmission scheme based on random linear network coding (RLNC). Specifically, the intended receiver generates a random matrix upon receiving the request from the source node, and then transmits each row vector of this matrix over a link reversely to the source node. Each intermediate node rearranges all received vectors to form a matrix by row, and then post-multiplies its local encoding kernel by this matrix to obtain a new matrix. Similarly, each row vector of the new matrix is reversely transmitted over a link to the source node. This procedure is performed until we have the source node, where the generalized inverse of the received matrix (or part of it) can be used as its local encoding kernel. Hence, the intended receiver can use the generated matrix (or the corresponding part) to decode the received data packets directly. We also analyze the security to demonstrate that the proposed scheme is at least as secure as other methods against wiretapping attacks. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its utility.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid development of modern artificial intelligence technique is mainly attributed to sufficient and high-quality data. However, in the data collection, personal privacy is at risk of being leaked. This issue can be addressed by federated learning, which is proposed to achieve efficient model training among multiple data providers without direct data access and aggregation. To encourage more parties owning high-quality data to participate in the federated learning, it is important to evaluate and reward the participant contribution in a reasonable, robust, and efficient manner. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel contribution estimation method: Intrinsic Performance Influence-based Contribution Estimation (IPICE). In particular, the class-level intrinsic performance influence is adopted as the contribution estimation criteria in IPICE, and a neural network is employed to exploit the non-linear relationship between the performance change and estimated contribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets, and the results demonstrate that IPICE is more accurate and stable than the counterpart in various data distribution settings. The computational complexity is significantly reduced in our IPICE, especially when a new party joins the federation. IPICE assigns small contributions to bad/garbage data and thus prevent them from participating and deteriorating the learning ecosystem.",

        "Title": "Machine Learning in Mobile Crowd Sourcing: A Behavior-Based Recruitment Model",
        "Abstract": "With the advent of mobile crowd sourcing (MCS) systems and its applications, the selection of the right crowd is gaining utmost importance. The increasing variability in the context of MCS tasks makes the selection of not only the capable but also the willing workers crucial for a high task completion rate. Most of the existing MCS selection frameworks rely primarily on reputation-based feedback mechanisms to assess the level of commitment of potential workers. Such frameworks select workers having high reputation scores but without any contextual awareness of the workers, at the time of selection, or the task. This may lead to an unfair selection of workers who will not perform the task. Hence, reputation on its own only gives an approximation of workers\u2019 behaviors since it assumes that workers always behave consistently regardless of the situational context. However, following the concept of cross-situational consistency, where people tend to show similar behavior in similar situations and behave differently in disparate ones, this work proposes a novel recruitment system in MCS based on behavioral profiling. The proposed approach uses machine learning to predict the probability of the workers performing a given task, based on their learned behavioral models. Subsequently, a group-based selection mechanism, based on the genetic algorithm, uses these behavioral models in complementation with a reputation-based model to recruit a group of workers that maximizes the quality of recruitment of the tasks. Simulations based on a real-life dataset show that considering human behavior in varying situations improves the quality of recruitment achieved by the tasks and their completion confidence when compared with a benchmark that relies solely on reputation.",

        "Abstract": "The proliferation of innovative mobile services such as augmented reality, networked gaming, and autonomous driving has spurred a growing need for low-latency access to computing resources that cannot be met solely by existing centralized cloud systems. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is expected to be an effective solution to meet the demand for low-latency services by enabling the execution of computing tasks at the network edge, in proximity to the end-users. While a number of recent studies have addressed the problem of determining the execution of service tasks and the routing of user requests to corresponding edge servers, the focus has primarily been on the efficient utilization of computing resources, neglecting the fact that non-trivial amounts of data need to be pre-stored to enable service execution, and that many emerging services exhibit asymmetric bandwidth requirements. To fill this gap, we study the joint optimization of service placement and request routing in dense MEC networks with multidimensional constraints. We show that this problem generalizes several well-known placement and routing problems and propose an algorithm that achieves close-to-optimal performance using a randomized rounding technique. Evaluation results demonstrate that our approach can effectively utilize available storage, computation, and communication resources to maximize the number of requests served by low-latency edge cloud servers.",

Unlike cloud computing, fog resources are based on constrained and heterogeneous nodes whose connectivity can be unstable. In this complex scenario, there is a need to define and implement orchestration processes to ensure that applications and services can be provided, considering the settled agreements. Although some publications have dealt with orchestration in fog computing, there are still some diverse definitions and functional intersection with other areas, such as resource management and monitoring. This article presents a systematic review of the literature with focus on orchestration in fog computing. A generic architecture of fog orchestration is presented, created from the consolidation of the analyzed proposals, bringing to light the essential functionalities addressed in the literature. This work also highlights the main challenges and open research questions.",

        "Title": "Distributed Broadcasting in Dynamic Networks",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate distributed broadcasting in dynamic networks, where the topology changes continually over time. We propose a network model that captures the dynamicity caused by both churn and mobility of nodes. In contrast to existing work on dynamic networks, our model defines the dynamicity in terms of localized topological changes in the vicinity of each node, rather than a global view of the whole network. Obviously, a local dynamic model suits distributed algorithms better than a global one. The proposed dynamic model uses the more realistic SINR model to depict wireless interference, instead of oversimplified graph-based models adopted in most existing work. We consider the fundamental communication primitive of global broadcast, which is to disseminate a message from a source node to the whole network. Specifically, we present a randomized distributed algorithm that can accomplish dynamic broadcasting in an asymptotically optimal running time of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$O(D_{T})$ </tex-math></inline-formula> with a high probability guarantee, under the assumption of reasonably constant <italic>dynamicity rate</italic>, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$D_{T}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is the <italic>dynamic diameter</italic>, a parameter proposed to depict the complexity of dynamic broadcasting. We believe our local dynamic model can greatly facilitate distributed algorithm studies in mobile and dynamic wireless networks.",

        "Abstract": "Collusion attacks are considered to be challenging attacks in audio copyright protection. The traditional watermarking algorithms cannot identify the traitors when other attacks, such as desynchronization attacks, are applied with a collusion attack. Instead of tracing the traitors, in this paper we aim to tackle collusion attacks by removing the commercial value from the colluded copy, which will demotivate the attackers from launching collusion attacks. Since the commercial value of an audio signal is directly reflected by its perceptual quality, we propose a novel non-linear-echo generation (NLEG) based algorithm to significantly degrade the perceptual quality of the colluded copy by embedding a time delay sequence into the host signal. The proposed NLEG is also designed to be resilient to common signal processing attacks and desynchronization attacks. Furthermore, the proposed NLEG can be combined with other digital watermarking techniques to enhance its performance on protecting the copyright information. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed NLEG.",

        "Title": "Delay-Based Network Utility Maximization Modelling for Congestion Control in Named Data Networking",
        "Abstract": "Content replication and name-based routing lead to a natural multi-source and multipath transmission paradigm in NDN. Due to the unique connectionless characteristic of NDN, current end-to-end multipath congestion control schemes (e.g. MPTCP) cannot be used directly on NDN. This paper proposes a Network Utility Maximization (NUM) model to formulate multi-source and multipath transmission in NDN with in-network caches. From this model, a family of receiver-driven transmission solutions can be derived, named as path-specified congestion control. The path-specified congestion control enables content consumers to separate the traffic control on each path, which consequently facilitates fair and efficient bandwidth sharing amongst all consumers. As a specific instance, a Delay-based Path-specified Congestion Control Protocol (DPCCP) is presented, which utilizes queuing delays as signals to measure and control congestion levels of different bottlenecks. In addition, a set of high-performance congestion control laws are designed to accelerate bandwidth and fairness convergence towards the optimum defined by the NUM model. Finally, DPCCP is compared with state-of-the-art solutions. The experimental evaluations show that DPCCP outperforms existing solutions in terms of bandwidth utilization, convergence time and packet loss.",

        "Title": "Five Facets of 6G: Research Challenges and Opportunities",
        "Abstract": "Whilst the fifth-generation (5G) systems are being rolled out across the globe, researchers have turned their attention to the exploration of radical next-generation solutions. At this early evolutionary stage we survey five main research facets of this field, namely Facet 1: next-generation architectures, spectrum and services, Facet 2: next-generation networking, Facet 3: Internet of Things (IoT), Facet 4: wireless positioning and sensing, as well as Facet 5: applications of deep learning in 6G networks. In this paper, we have provided a critical appraisal of the literature of promising techniques ranging from the associated architectures, networking, applications as well as designs. We have portrayed a plethora of heterogeneous architectures relying on cooperative hybrid networks supported by diverse access and transmission mechanisms. The vulnerabilities of these techniques are also addressed and carefully considered for highlighting the most of promising future research directions. Additionally, we have listed a rich suite of learning-driven optimization techniques. We conclude by observing the evolutionary paradigm-shift that has taken place from pure single-component bandwidth-efficiency, power-efficiency or delay-optimization towards multi-component designs, as exemplified by the twin-component ultra-reliable low-latency mode of the 5G system. We advocate a further evolutionary step towards multi-component Pareto optimization, which requires the exploration of the entire Pareto front of all optiomal solutions, where none of the components of the objective function may be improved without degrading at least one of the other components.",

        "Title": "A Survey of Practical Formal Methods for Security",
        "Abstract": "In today\u2019s world, critical infrastructure is often controlled by computing systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking, and lightweight FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed, compared, and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers, commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety-critical systems, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends, and directions of research within this field.",

        "Abstract": "Data-driven machine learning (ML) has witnessed great success across a variety of application domains. Since ML model training relies on a large amount of data, there is a growing demand for high-quality data to be collected for ML model training. Data markets can be employed to significantly facilitate data collection. In this work, we demonstrate Dealer, an en<u>D</u>-to-end mod<u>e</u>l m<u>a</u>rketp<u>l</u>ace with diff<u>e</u>rential p<u>r</u>ivacy. Dealer consists of three entities, data owners, the broker, and model buyers. Data owners receive compensation for their data usages allocated by the broker; The broker collects data from data owners, builds and sells models to model buyers; Model buyers buy their target models from the broker. We demonstrate the functionalities of the three participating entities and the abbreviated interactions between them. The demonstration allows the audience to understand and experience interactively the process of model trading. The audience can act as a data owner to control what and how the data would be compensated, can act as a broker to price machine learning models with maximum revenue, as well as can act as a model buyer to purchase target models that meet expectations.",

        "Title": "Machine Learning at the Network Edge: A Survey",
        "Abstract": "Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However, deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge of the network, i.e., close to the IoT devices where the data is generated. Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources. This survey describes major research efforts where machine learning systems have been deployed at the edge of computer networks, focusing on the operational aspects including compression techniques, tools, frameworks, and hardware used in successful applications of intelligent edge systems.",

        "Title": "Conditional Identity Privacy-preserving Authentication Scheme Based on Cooperation of Multiple Fog Servers under Fog Computing-based IoVs",
        "Abstract": "Internet of vehicles (IoVs) is a variant of vehicular ad hoc network, which provides an efficient communication method for vehicles. However, some traffic messages usually include sensitive identity information, which is easy to bring about the leakage of vehicular identities during data communications. Further, if vehicular identities are fully protected, then it can lead to trusted authority cannot reveal the real identities of malicious vehicles, which incurs more security issues in IoVs. Therefore, in this article, we propose an efficient conditional identity privacy-preserving authentication scheme based on cooperation of multiple fog servers under fog computing-based IoVs, where fog servers are used to verify (authenticate) the legitimacy of vehicles without revealing their real identities. Further, an associated vehicular identity updating mechanism is constructed to solve the problem that some compromised fog servers may leak their stored verification information to pool real vehicular identities. Additionally, a malicious vehicular identity tracing mechanism is proposed to support related fog servers that receive signed false messages can trace the real identities of malicious vehicles. Compared with other related schemes, our scheme further improves its security. Experimental results show our scheme is efficient under fog computing-based IoVs.",

        "Abstract": "The growth of IoT technology, increasing prevalence of embedded devices, and advancements in biomedical technology have led to the emergence of numerous wearable health monitoring devices (WHMDs) in clinical settings and in the community. The majority of these devices are Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled. Though the advantages offered by BLE-enabled WHMDs in tracking, diagnosing, and intervening with patients are substantial, the risk of cyberattacks on these devices is likely to increase with device complexity and new communication protocols. Furthermore, vendors face risk and financial tradeoffs between speed to market and ensuring device security in all situations. Previous research has explored the security and privacy of such devices by manually testing popular BLE-enabled WHMDs in the market and generally discussed categories of possible attacks, while mostly focused on IP devices. In this work, we propose a new semi-automated framework that can be used to identify and discover both known and unknown vulnerabilities in WHMDs. To demonstrate its implementation, we validate it with a number of commercially available BLE-enabled enabled wearable devices. Our results show that the devices are vulnerable to a number of attacks, including eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks. The proposed framework could therefore be used to evaluate potential devices before adoption into a secure network or, ideally, during the design and implementation of new devices.",

In response, data federation systems have emerged to perform secure queries across multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation. However, existing systems are designed for relational data. They are highly inefficient on spatial queries and limited in usability. In this demonstration, we introduce Hu-Fu, the first data federation system for secure spatial queries with high efficiency and usability. Hu-Fu is designed from the perspectives of the query user and the data owner for high usability and decomposes a spatial query into as many plaintext operators and as few secure operators as possible for high efficiency. We demonstrate the deployment and usage of Hu-Fu via cross-company taxi-calling, a popular smart city application.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest Internet evolution that incorporates a diverse range of things such as sensors, actuators, and services deployed by different organizations and individuals to support a variety of applications. The information captured by IoT present an unprecedented opportunity to solve large-scale problems in those application domains to deliver services; example applications include precision agriculture, environment monitoring, smart health, smart manufacturing, and smart cities. Like all other Internet based services in the past, IoT-based services are also being developed and deployed without security consideration. By nature, IoT devices and services are vulnerable to malicious cyber threats as they cannot be given the same protection that is received by enterprise services within an enterprise perimeter. While IoT services will play an important role in our daily life resulting in improved productivity and quality of life, the trend has also \u201cencouraged\u201d cyber-exploitation and evolution and diversification of malicious cyber threats. Hence, there is a need for coordinated efforts from the research community to address resulting concerns, such as those presented in this special section. Several potential research topics are also identified in this special section.",

        "Title": "Privacy Intelligence: A Survey on Image Privacy in Online Social Networks",
        "Abstract": "Image sharing on online social networks (OSNs) has become an indispensable part of daily social activities, but it has also increased the risk of privacy invasion. An online image can reveal various types of sensitive information, prompting the public to rethink individual privacy needs in OSN image sharing critically. However, the interaction of images and OSN makes the privacy issues significantly complicated. The current real-world solutions for privacy management fail to provide adequate personalized, accurate, and flexible privacy protection. Constructing a more intelligent environment for privacy-friendly OSN image sharing is urgent in the near future. Meanwhile, given the dynamics in both users\u2019 privacy needs and OSN context, a comprehensive understanding of OSN image privacy throughout the entire sharing process is preferable to any views from a single side, dimension, or level. To fill this gap, we contribute a survey of \u201cprivacy intelligence\u201d that targets modern privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective. Specifically, we present the important properties and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, along with a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN image sharing and their associated privacy issues. Then a systematic review of representative intelligent solutions to those privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The analysis results in an intelligent \u201cprivacy firewall\u201d for closed-loop privacy management. Challenges and future directions in this area are also discussed.",

        "Abstract": "Constructing energy-efficient database systems to reduce economic costs and environmental impact has been studied for 10 years. With the emergence of the big data age, along with the data-centric and data-intensive computing trend, the great amount of energy consumed by database systems has become a major concern in a society that pursues Green IT. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this matter in Green IT, there have been few comprehensive or systematic studies conducted in this field. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a literature survey with breadth and depth on existing energy management techniques for database systems. The existing literature is organized hierarchically with two major branches focusing separately on energy consumption models and energy-saving techniques. Under each branch, we first introduce some basic knowledge, then we classify, discuss, and compare existing research according to their core ideas, basic approaches, and main characteristics. Finally, based on these observations through our study, we identify multiple open issues and challenges, and provide insights for future research. It is our hope that our outcome of this work will help researchers develop more energy-efficient database systems.",

        "Abstract": "The prosperity of machine learning has been accompanied by increasing attacks on the training process. Among them, poisoning attacks have become an emerging threat during model training. Poisoning attacks have profound impacts on the target models, e.g., making them unable to converge or manipulating their prediction results. Moreover, the rapid development of recent distributed learning frameworks, especially federated learning, has further stimulated the development of poisoning attacks. Defending against poisoning attacks is challenging and urgent. However, the systematic review from a unified perspective remains blank. This survey provides an in-depth and up-to-date overview of poisoning attacks and corresponding countermeasures in both centralized and federated learning. We firstly categorize attack methods based on their goals. Secondly, we offer detailed analysis of the differences and connections among the attack techniques. Furthermore, we present countermeasures in different learning framework and highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the reasons for the feasibility of poisoning attacks and address the potential research directions from attacks and defenses perspectives, separately.",

DIRECTGO collects various deterministic derivative-free DIRECT-type algorithms for box-constrained, generally constrained, and problems with hidden constraints. Each sequential algorithm is implemented in two ways: using static and dynamic data structures for more efficient information storage and organization. Furthermore, parallel schemes are applied to some promising algorithms within DIRECTGO. The toolbox is equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring the user-friendly use of all functionalities available in DIRECTGO. Available features are demonstrated in detailed computational studies using a comprehensive DIRECTGOLib v1.0 library of global optimization test problems. Additionally, 11 classical engineering design problems illustrate the potential of DIRECTGO to solve challenging real-world problems. Finally, the appendix gives examples of accompanying MATLAB programs and provides a synopsis of its use on the test problems with box and general constraints.",

With the increasing demand of society and the continuous progress of technologies, UAV communication networks (UAVCN) are also flourishing. The mobility of UAV nodes allows for flexible network deployment, but some challenges are brought, such as power constraints, throughput, cost, and time efficiency. Therefore, path planning is significant for UAVCN. This paper presents a review of UAVCN path planning. We first introduce the network structure and performance evaluation of UAVCN. We then investigate the generic UAV path planning algorithms and the path planning algorithms in UAVCN. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of each path planning algorithm and the functional problems. The challenges faced in path planning for UAVCN, the solutions, state-of-the-art, and representative results are also presented. In addition, we illustrate future research directions for UAVCN path planning as well, which can provide some help to researchers.",

        "Abstract": "IoT devices can be used to complete a wide array of physical tasks, but due to factors such as low computational resources and distributed physical deployment, they are susceptible to a wide array of faulty behaviors. Many devices deployed in homes, vehicles, industrial sites, and hospitals carry a great risk of damage to property, harm to a person, or breach of security if they behave faultily. We propose a general fault handling system named IoTRepair, which shows promising results for effectiveness with limited latency and power overhead in an IoT environment. IoTRepair dynamically organizes and customizes fault-handling techniques to address the unique problems associated with heterogeneous IoT deployments. We evaluate IoTRepair by creating a physical implementation mirroring a typical home environment to motivate the effectiveness of this system. Our evaluation showed that each of our fault-handling functions could be completed within 100 milliseconds after fault identification, which is a fraction of the time that state-of-the-art fault-identification methods take (measured in minutes). The power overhead is equally small, with the computation and device action consuming less than 30 milliwatts. This evaluation shows that IoTRepair not only can be deployed in a physical system, but offers significant benefits at a low overhead.",

        "Abstract": "Data privacy is a very important issue. Especially in fields like medicine, it is paramount to abide by the existing privacy regulations to preserve patients\u2019 anonymity. However, data is required for research and training machine learning models that could help gain insight into complex correlations or personalised treatments that may otherwise stay undiscovered. Those models generally scale with the amount of data available, but the current situation often prohibits building large databases across sites. So it would be beneficial to be able to combine similar or related data from different sites all over the world while still preserving data privacy. Federated learning has been proposed as a solution for this, because it relies on the sharing of machine learning models, instead of the raw data itself. That means private data never leaves the site or device it was collected on. Federated learning is an emerging research area, and many domains have been identified for the application of those methods. This systematic literature review provides an extensive look at the concept of and research into federated learning and its applicability for confidential healthcare datasets.",

        "Abstract": "The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.",

        "Abstract": "Recent years have seen the rapid development and integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. The market is providing various consumer-oriented smart IoT devices; the mainstream cloud service providers are building their software stacks to support IoT services. With this emerging trend even growing, the security of such smart IoT cloud systems has drawn much research attention in recent years. To better understand the emerging consumer-oriented smart IoT cloud systems for practical engineers and new researchers, this article presents a review of the most recent research efforts on existing, real, already deployed consumer-oriented IoT cloud applications in the past five years using typical case studies. Specifically, we first present a general model for the IoT cloud ecosystem. Then, using the model, we review and summarize recent, representative research works on emerging smart IoT cloud system security using 10 detailed case studies, with the aim that the case studies together provide insights into the insecurity of current emerging IoT cloud systems. We further present a systematic approach to conduct a security analysis for IoT cloud systems. Based on the proposed security analysis approach, we review and suggest potential security risk mitigation methods to protect IoT cloud systems. We also discuss future research challenges for the IoT cloud security area.",

        "Abstract": "With the continued deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), increasing volumes of devices are being deployed that emit massive spatially referenced data. Due in part to the dynamic, decentralized, and heterogeneous architecture of the IoT, the varying and often low quality of spatial IoT data (SID) presents challenges to applications built on top of this data. This survey aims to provide unique insight to practitioners who intend to develop IoT-enabled applications and to researchers who wish to conduct research that relates to data quality in the IoT setting. The survey offers an inventory analysis of major data quality dimensions in SID and covers significant data characteristics and associated quality considerations. The survey summarizes data quality related technologies from both task and technique perspectives. Organizing the technologies from the task perspective, it covers recent progress in SID quality management, encompassing location refinement, uncertainty elimination, outlier removal, fault correction, data integration, and data reduction; and it covers low-quality SID exploitation, encompassing querying, analysis, and decision-making techniques. Finally, the survey covers emerging trends and open issues concerning the quality of SID.",

        "Title": "A Survey on Ransomware: Evolution, Taxonomy, and Defense Solutions",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end-users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial losses of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, and is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.",

        "Title": "Edge Computing in the Dark: Leveraging Contextual-Combinatorial Bandit and Coded Computing",
        "Abstract": "With recent advancements in edge computing capabilities, there has been a significant increase in utilizing the edge cloud for event-driven and time-sensitive computations. However, large-scale edge computing networks can suffer substantially from unpredictable and unreliable computing resources which can result in high variability of service quality. We consider the problem of computation offloading over unknown edge cloud networks with a sequence of timely computation jobs. Motivated by the MapReduce computation paradigm, we assume that each computation job can be partitioned to smaller Map functions which are processed at the edge, and the Reduce function is computed at the user after the Map results are collected from the edge nodes. We model the service quality of each edge device as function of context. The user decides the computations to offload to each device with the goal of receiving a recoverable set of computation results in the given deadline. By leveraging the <italic>coded computing</italic> framework in order to tackle failures or stragglers in computation, we formulate this problem using contextual-combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CC-MAB), and aim to maximize the cumulative expected reward. We propose an online learning policy called <italic>online coded edge computing policy</italic>, which provably achieves asymptotically-optimal performance in terms of regret loss compared with the optimal offline policy for the proposed CC-MAB problem. In terms of the cumulative reward, it is shown that the online coded edge computing policy significantly outperforms other benchmarks via numerical studies.",

        "Abstract": "<italic>Background:</italic> In medicine, chromosome karyotyping analysis plays a crucial role in prenatal diagnosis for diagnosing whether a fetus has severe defects or genetic diseases.

After that, we design a chromosome instance labeled dataset augmentation (<italic>CILA</italic>) algorithm for the clinical dataset to improve the generalization performance of deep learning-based models. Last, we propose a chromosome instance segmentation framework and implement multiple baselines for the proposed framework based on various instance segmentation models. <italic>Results and Conclusions:</italic>Experiments evaluated on the clinical dataset show that the best baseline of the proposed framework based on the Mask-RCNN model yields an outstanding result with <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$77\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>77</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq1-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$mAP$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq2-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$97.5\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>97</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq3-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$AP^{50}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq4-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$95.5\\%\\ AP^{75}$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo><mml:mspace width=\"4pt\"/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mn>75</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq5-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> segmentation <italic>precision</italic>, and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$95.38\\%$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>95</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>38</mml:mn><mml:mo>%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"lin-ieq6-3089507.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> <italic>accuracy</italic>, which exceeds results reported in current chromosome instance segmentation methods.

There has been a plethora of research in this area, resulting in an outburst of publications over the past two years. Choosing the right algorithm to solve a complex security problem in a very precise industrial context is a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Learning Algorithm Recommendation Framework that, for a clearly defined situation, guides the selection of learning algorithm and scientific discipline (e.g. RNN, GAN, RL, CNN,...) which have sparked great interest to the scientific community and which therefore offers preponderant elements and benefits for further deployments. This framework has the advantage of having been generated from an extensive analysis of the literature, as illustrated by this paper for the recurrent neural networks and their variations.",

Although robust, BFT-SMR protocols are very costly in terms of the number of required replicas (3f+1 to tolerate f faults) and of exchanged messages. However, with \"hybrid\" architectures, where \"normal\" components trust some \"special\" components to provide properties in a trustworthy manner, the cost of using BFT can be dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, even though such hybridization techniques decrease the message/time/space complexity of BFT protocols, they also increase their structural complexity.",

        "Abstract": "In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan city, China and has been reported in many countries with millions of people infected within only four months. Chest computed Tomography (CT) has proven to be a useful supplement to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and has been shown to have high sensitivity to diagnose this condition. Therefore, radiological examinations are becoming crucial in early examination of COVID-19 infection. Currently, CT findings have already been suggested as an important evidence for scientific examination of COVID-19 in Hubei, China. However, classification of patient from chest CT images is not an easy task. Therefore, in this paper, a deep bidirectional long short-term memory network with mixture density network (DBM) model is proposed. To tune the hyperparameters of the DBM model, a Memetic Adaptive Differential Evolution (MADE) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments are drawn by considering the benchmark chest-Computed Tomography (chest-CT) images datasets. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed MADE-DBM model outperforms the competitive COVID-19 classification approaches in terms of various performance metrics. Therefore, the proposed MADE-DBM model can be used in real-time COVID-19 classification systems.",

        "Abstract": "This investigation focuses on the application of computational intelligence to the security of Digital Twins (DTs) graphic data of the Cyber-physical System (CPS). The intricate and diverse physical space of CPS in the smart city is mapped in virtual space to construct the DTs CPS in the smart city. Besides, Differential Privacy Frequent Subgraph-Big Multigraph (DPFS-BM) is employed to ensure data privacy security. Moreover, the analysis and prediction model for the DTs big graphic data (BGD) in the CPS is built based on Differential Privacy-AlexNet (DP-AlexNet). Alexnet successfully solves the gradient dispersion problem of the Sigmoid function of deep network structures. Finally, the comparative analysis approach is utilized to verify the performance of the model reported here by comparing it with Long Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, original AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron in a simulation experiment. Through the comparison in the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error, training time, and test time, the model proposed here outperforms other models regarding errors, time delay, and time consumption. In the same environment, the system performs better with multi-hop paths, extra relays, and a high fading index; in that case, the outage probability is minimal. Therefore, the DP-AlexNet model is suitable for processing BGD. Moreover, its speed acceleration is more apparent than that of other models, with a higher SpeedUp indicator. The research effectively combines data mining and data security, which is of significant value for optimizing the privacy protection technology of frequent subgraph mining on a single multi-graph. Besides, the constructed DTs of CPS can provide excellent accuracy and a prominent acceleration effect on the premise of low errors. In addition, the model reported here can provide reference for the intelligent and digital development of smart cities.",

        "Abstract": "Diversity is a great challenge for software engineers in the social sector context. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the identification of the RE processes and associated challenges in releasing the software in the social sector markets for which an exploratory case study is conducted. The outcome of the case study indicates that the diversity limits the ability to involve the representative samples of user populations using the same set of RE tools and techniques as one size fits all solution for all segments. The diverse user base must be partitioned into different segments, with each segment triggered using a suitable set of RE techniques i.e., traditional and crowd-based RE. The diverse perspectives learned as a result of the interaction with each segment, must be merged together into a single perspective about the software meant to be used in the social sector. There is a need for a new RE process specially designed for handling the complexities of the social sector, which this paper terms as Social Sector Requirement Engineering (SSRE). There is an increased need for collaboration between government social sector institutions and software engineers to get access to diverse customers to improve software quality.",

        "Abstract": "Today, users of social platforms upload a large number of photos. These photos contain personal private information, including user identity information, which is easily gleaned by intelligent detection algorithms. To thwart this, in this work, we propose an intelligent algorithm to prevent deep neural network (DNN) detectors from detecting private information, especially human faces, while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of the image. More specifically, we design an image privacy protection algorithm by training and generating a corresponding adversarial sample for each image to defend DNN detectors. In addition, we propose an improved model based on the previous model by training an adversarial perturbation generative network to generate perturbation instead of training for each image. We evaluate and compare our proposed algorithm with other methods on wider face dataset and others by three indicators: Mean average precision, Averaged distortion, and Time spent. The results show that our method significantly interferes with DNN detectors while causing weak impact to the visual quality of images, and our improved model does speed up the generation of adversarial perturbations.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid advancement of video and image processing technologies in the Internet of Things, it is urgent to address the issues in real-time performance, clarity, and reliability of image recognition technology for a monitoring system in foggy weather conditions. In this work, a fast defogging image recognition algorithm is proposed based on bilateral hybrid filtering. First, the mathematical model based on bilateral hybrid filtering is established. The dark channel is used for filtering and denoising the defogging image. Next, a bilateral hybrid filtering method is proposed by using a combination of guided filtering and median filtering, as it can effectively improve the robustness and transmittance of defogging images. On this basis, the proposed algorithm dramatically decreases the computation complexity of defogging image recognition and reduces the image execution time. Experimental results show that the defogging effect and speed are promising, with the image recognition rate reaching to 98.8% after defogging.",

        "Abstract": "Block chain provides an innovative solution to information storage, transaction execution, security, and trust building in an open environment. The block chain is technological progress for cyber security and cryptography, with efficiency-related cases varying in smart grids, smart contracts, over the IoT, etc. The movement to exchange data on a server has massively increased with the introduction of the Internet of Things. Hence, in this research, Splitting of proxy re-encryption method (Split-PRE) has been suggested based on the IoT to improve security and privacy in a private block chain. This study proposes a block chain-based proxy re-encryption program to resolve both the trust and scalability problems and to simplify the transactions. After encryption, the system saves the Internet of Things data in a distributed cloud. The framework offers dynamic, smart contracts between the sensor and the device user without the intervention of a trustworthy third party to exchange the captured IoT data. It uses an efficient proxy re-encryption system, which provides the owner and the person existing in the smart contract to see the data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed approach enhances the efficiency, security, privacy, and feasibility of the system when compared to other existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) now is one of the most important approach to instantiate asymmetric encryption and signature schemes, which has been extensively exploited to protect the security of cyber-physical systems. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a great deal of constrained devices may require software implementations of ECC operations. Under this circumstances, the SM2, a set of public key cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curves published by Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office, was standardized at ISO in 2017 to enhance the cyber-security. However, few research works on the implementation of SM2 for constrained devices have been conducted. In this work, we fill this gap and propose our efficient, secure, and compact implementation of scalar multiplication on a 256-bit elliptic curve recommended by the SM2, as well as a comparison implementation of scalar multiplication on the same bit-length elliptic curve recommended by NIST. We re-design some existent techniques to fit the low-end IoT platform, namely 8-bit AVR processors, and our implementations evaluated on the desired platform show that the SM2 algorithms have competitive efficiency and security with NIST, which would work well to secure the IoT world.",

        "Abstract": "Fake news detection recently received a lot of attention from the scientific community and demands an optimal solution with high efficiency. Several studies were conducted using unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to address the fake news identification problem. These studies, on the other hand, have some limitations like inefficient model design, improper pre-processing, and poor accuracy. Some factors contributing to poor accuracy include irrelevant features, improper model parameters, imbalanced datasets, and so on. This work proposes an optimized deep learning model for detecting fake news. The developed model uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to classify fake and real news and utilizes hyperparameter tuning methods such as grid search and random search to customize the hyperparameters of the model. The experimental results indicate that the optimized LSTM model yields 99.65% accuracy using the ISOT dataset and 45.23% accuracy using the LIAR dataset.",

In this article, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and mobile edge computing (MEC) technology are adopted to formulate a DRL-MEC-based jamming-aided anti-eavesdropping (DMEC-JAE) scheme to resist the eavesdropping attack without considering the channel state information. In this scheme, a MEC sensor is chosen to send artificial jamming signals to improve the secrecy rate of the system. Power control technique is utilized to optimize the transmission power of both the source sensor and the MEC sensor to save energy. The remaining energy of the MEC sensor is concerned to ensure routine data transmission and jamming signal transmission. Additionally, the DMEC-JAE scheme integrates with transfer learning for a higher learning rate. The performance bounds of the scheme concerning the secrecy rate, energy consumption, and the utility are evaluated. Simulation results show that the DMEC-JAE scheme can approach the performance bounds with high learning speed, which outperforms the benchmark schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Federated Edge Learning (FEL) allows edge nodes to train a global deep learning model collaboratively for edge computing in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which significantly promotes the development of Industrial 4.0. However, FEL faces two critical challenges: communication overhead and data privacy. FEL suffers from expensive communication overhead when training large-scale multi-node models. Furthermore, due to the vulnerability of FEL to gradient leakage and label-flipping attacks, the training process of the global model is easily compromised by adversaries. To address these challenges, we propose a communication-efficient and privacy-enhanced asynchronous FEL framework for edge computing in IIoT. First, we introduce an asynchronous model update scheme to reduce the computation time that edge nodes wait for global model aggregation. Second, we propose an asynchronous local differential privacy mechanism, which improves communication efficiency and mitigates gradient leakage attacks by adding well-designed noise to the gradients of edge nodes. Third, we design a cloud-side malicious node detection mechanism to detect malicious nodes by testing the local model quality. Such a mechanism can avoid malicious nodes participating in training to mitigate label-flipping attacks. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only improve communication efficiency but also mitigate malicious attacks while its accuracy is comparable to traditional FEL frameworks.",

By using k-anonymity (K-A) and differential privacy (DP), an algorithm model combining K-A and DP was proposed, which was simulated through the experiments. In the Magic and EIA datasets, the algorithm constructed was compared with K-A and the L-diversity model to verify the performance of the model. The model constructed based on DP had the lowest privacy-leakage risks, which increased with the number of identifiers in the Magic and EIA datasets, and the information disclosure was the least. In addition, in its usability analysis, it was found that its value was the most obviously improved and its operation efficiency was the highest. The K-A-DP algorithm can effectively reduce the risk of privacy leakage and information loss, and has achieved excellent results. Despite the deficiencies in the process of the experiment, the study still provides a reference for solving the problem of medical data security.",

        "Abstract": "Access to resources by users may need to be granted only upon certain conditions and contexts, perhaps particularly in cyber-physical settings. Unfortunately, creating and modifying context-sensitive access control solutions in dynamic environments creates ongoing challenges to manage the authorization contexts. This article proposes RASA, a context-sensitive access authorization approach and mechanism leveraging unsupervised machine learning to automatically infer risk-based authorization decision boundaries. We explore RASA in a healthcare usage environment, wherein cyber and physical conditions create context-specific risks for protecting private health information. The risk levels are associated with access control decisions recommended by a security policy. A coupling method is introduced to track coexistence of the objects within context using frequency and duration of coexistence, and these are clustered to reveal sets of actions with common risk levels; these are used to create authorization decision boundaries. In addition, we propose a method for assessing the risk level and labelling the clusters with respect to their corresponding risk levels. We evaluate the promise of RASA-generated policies against a heuristic rule-based policy. By employing three different coupling features (frequency-based, duration-based, and combined features), the decisions of the unsupervised method and that of the policy are more than 99% consistent.",

        "Title": "Addressing Waste Separation With a Persuasive Augmented Reality App",
        "Abstract": "Separating and recycling waste is an important topic to protect our environment and achieve a more sustainable future. However, recycling also is a complex process, as each type of waste needs a specific recycling method. This comes along with multiple recycling containers, each relevant for one specific type of waste. Ensuring a correct recycling process therefore not only requires specific infrastructure, but also a respective attitude and knowledge of the population. Stressing the need for an accessible educational opportunity addressing waste separation, we present a mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application that guides a user through a recycling process and hence scaffolds the learning of proper recycling of each type of waste. The app further provides a prototypical implementation of a product scanner, that identifies the waste type based on a marker and assists the recycling on a case-by-case decision. Using self-determination theory as a framework, we integrated gamification elements, aiming for enhanced need satisfaction, motivation and user experience. In a user study, we compared the gamified version to a control version, with both app versions yielding a high acceptance, user experience, and waste separation behavior. This indicates the importance of providing easy-to-use mobile apps allowing for a learning and assistance of proper recycling.",

To achieve a low response time, stringent timing requirements are needed for task scheduling in a large-scale server farm spanning thousands of servers.

        "Abstract": "To study the security performance of the Internet of multimedia things on the privacy protection of user identity, behavior trajectory, and preference under the new information technology industry wave, in this study, aiming at the problems of the sharing of Internet of things perception data and the exposure of users\u2019 privacy information, the Anonymous Batch Authentication Scheme (ABAH) for privacy protection is designed. Hash-based Message Authentication Code is used to cancel the list-checking process and analyze its security performance. Compared with the methods of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, Bayes least-square method, identity-based bulk verification, anonymous batch authentication and key protocol, conditional privacy authentication scheme, and expert message authentication protocol, the transmission delay, packet loss rate, and computation cost are studied without considering the undo list and during the undo check. The results show that with the increase of information size, the transmission delay and packet loss rate also increase, and the transmission delay of ABAH increases by about 15%, while the correlation between speed and transmission delay is small. In the case of the same amount of validation information, ABAH has the highest validation efficiency, and it still has an efficient validation effect in the case of invalid information. The message packet loss rate for ABAH is always 0 when the undo check validation overhead is considered. It can be found that ABAH can avoid the communication overhead and privacy leakage caused by the revocation list, ensure the integrity of batch verification information, meet the security performance of the vehicular ad hoc network under the Internet of Things, and protect the privacy of users from being disclosed.",

For the Internet of Things (IoT), LoRaWAN is one of the dominant technologies for urban environments, industrial settings, or critical infrastructures due to its low-power and long-range capabilities. LoRaWAN IoT deployments are expected to operate for multiple years or even decades. Hence, it is imperative to maintain operational security at all times while continuously evolving the security of the standard and its implementations. We survey LoRaWAN security and follow a systematic and evolvable approach that can be dynamically updated. To this end, we propose a novel methodology to create evolvable surveys which relate the analyzed critical security concepts, thus allowing IT security experts to reason about LoRaWAN security properties over time. With this, we provide a tool to hardware manufacturers, software developers and providers, and network operators to achieve sustainable security for IoT deployments.",

        "Abstract": "For Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications, reliable autonomous driving systems usually perform the majority of their computations on the cloud due to the limited computing power of edge devices. The communication delay between cloud platforms and edge devices, however, can cause dangerous consequences, particularly for latency-sensitive object detection tasks. Object detection tasks are also vulnerable to significantly degraded model performance caused by unknown objects, which creates unsafe driving conditions. To address these problems, this study develops an orchestrated system that allows real-time object detection and incrementally learns unknown objects in a complex and dynamic environment. A YOLO-based object detection model in edge computing mode uses thermal images to detect objects accurately in poor lighting conditions. In addition, an attention mechanism improves the system\u2019s performance without significantly increasing model complexity. An unknown object detector (UOD) automatically classifies and labels unknown objects without direct supervision on edge devices, while a roadside unit (RSU)-based mechanism is developed to update classes and ensure a secure driving experience for autonomous vehicles. Moreover, the interactions between edge devices, RSU servers, and the cloud are designed to allow efficient collaboration. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system learns uncategorized objects dynamically and detects instances accurately.",

To investigate the factors influencing university students using new generation of information technology in intelligent foreign language learning, this study proposed a research model based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The sample data were collected from a survey of 237 students at a university. The analysis of structural equation modeling indicated that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, construction of foreign language intelligence classroom, and computer self-efficacy all have a positive impact on learners\u2019 behavioral intention. These findings suggest that more emphasis should be laid on students\u2019 learning characteristics, advantages of new generation of technology, as well as teachers\u2019 intelligent literacy, so as to further promote the deep integration of the new-generation information technology and intelligent foreign language learning, improving the learning effectiveness ultimately and effectively.",

        "Abstract": "Pneumothorax is a common pulmonary disease that can lead to dyspnea and can be life-threatening. X-ray examination is the main means to diagnose this disease. Computer-aided diagnosis of pneumothorax on chest X-ray, as a prerequisite for a timely cure, has been widely studied, but it is still not satisfactory to achieve highly accurate results. In this paper, an image classification algorithm based on the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is proposed for high-resolution medical image analysis of pneumothorax X-rays, which features a Network In Network (NIN) for cleaning the data, random histogram equalization data augmentation processing, and a DCNN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively increase the correct diagnosis rate of pneumothorax, and the Area under Curve (AUC) of the test verified in the experiment is 0.9844 on ZJU-2 test data and 0.9906 on the ChestX-ray14, respectively. In addition, a large number of atmospheric pleura samples are visualized and analyzed based on the experimental results and in-depth learning characteristics of the algorithm. The analysis results verify the validity of feature extraction for the network. Combined with the results of these two aspects, the proposed X-ray image processing algorithm can effectively improve the classification accuracy of pneumothorax photographs.",

The optimization problem is investigated in the ASCTN, which is a discrete, non-linear, and non-convex problem with the limitation of computation ability of satellite and transmit power. Specifically, with the objective to minimize the cost utility related to latency and energy consumption, a joint affective services tasks computing offloading strategy, sub-channel, and power allocation algorithm based on dueling deep Q-network (Dueling-DQN) is proposed, which is in possession of better stability. The simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm in terms of the cost utility in the ASCTN system.",

        "Title": "Consortium of Municipalities Co-tailoring a Governmental e-Service Platform: What could go wrong?",
        "Abstract": "Governments and public sector organizations are digitalizing their service provisions to cut costs, improve public administration efficiency, provide better services to citizens and companies, or increase transparency of expenditure and decision-making. Often these attempts are local where each agency, city, municipality, or even a single department develops its own solutions. However, it is difficult to scale these up to broader contexts, e.g., governmental or regional level since they are designed for local needs. From this perspective, top-down initiatives, such as the use of common platforms, may result in more benefits. In this paper, we study a government-initiated platform for citizen-civil servant messaging in eight municipalities, each autonomously making decisions related to their service provision. The municipalities got a shared grant to co-tailor the platform to save resources and to learn together how to make best out of it and avoid possible problems. We study why this joint endeavor turned out to be difficult by utilizing the windows of opportunity theory as a research lens. We identify different challenges in service co-tailoring, including dissimilar practices, processes, skills and competencies, and attitudes and goals, and argue that co-tailoring and co-experimentation necessitates careful planning and consideration of these differences.",

        "Title": "Digital Democracy: Past, Present, Future An Interview with Vinton G. Cerf Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google",
        "Abstract": "In this 2019 interview, Vint Cerf, co-creator of the Internet, reflects on the evolution of the Internet from a computational to a social medium. He shares his concerns about the spread of disinformation and the way that the negative feedback loop created by rating systems encourage the propagation of sensationalism and falsehoods. He argues that, while authentication technology, in particular, will play an important role in fostering a more civil and civic Internet, ultimately, the solutions for strengthening democracy lie less with technology than in critical thinking by individuals and more democratically governed, bottom-up, and consensus-based institutions. Some of these institutions already exist while new ones have yet to be invented with robust new governance mechanisms to foster international collaboration on some of the hardest issues of our time.",

        "Abstract": "Identifying motifs in promoter regions is crucial to our understanding of transcription regulation. Researchers commonly use known promoter features in a variety of species to predict promoter motifs. However the results are not particularly useful. Different species rarely have similar features in promoter binding sites. In this study, we adopt sequence analysis techniques to find the possible promoter binding sites among different species. We sought to improve the existing algorithm to suit the task of mining sequential patterns with specific number of gaps. Moreover, we discuss the implementation of proposed method in a distributed environment. The proposed method finds the transcription start sites (TSS) and extracts possible promoter regions from DNA sequences according to TSS. We derived the motifs in the possible promoter regions, while taking into account the number of gaps in the motifs to deal with unimportant nucleotides. The motifs generated from promoter regions using the proposed methodology were shown to tolerate unimportant nucleotides. A comparison with known promoter motifs verified the efficacy of the proposed method.",

        "Abstract": "As a critical branch of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the medicine industry, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) significantly improves the quality of healthcare due to its real-time monitoring and low medical cost. Benefiting from edge and cloud computing, IoMT is provided with more computing and storage resources near the terminal to meet the low-delay requirements of computation-intensive services. However, the service offloading from health monitoring units (HMUs) to edge servers generates additional energy consumption. Fortunately, artificial intelligence (AI), which has developed rapidly in recent years, has proved effective in some resource allocation applications. Taking both energy consumption and delay into account, we propose an energy-aware service offloading algorithm under an end-edge-cloud collaborative IoMT system with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C), named ECAC. Technically, ECAC uses the structural similarity between the natural distributed IoMT system and A3C, whose parameters are asynchronously updated. Besides, due to the typical delay-sensitivity mechanism and time-energy correction, ECAC can adjust dynamically to the diverse service types and system requirements. Finally, the effectiveness of ECAC for IoMT is proved on real data.",

        "Title": "Metadata Harvesting and Quality Assurance within Open Urban Platforms",
        "Abstract": "During the past years, various activities and concepts have shaped and prepared the path for the development of urban environments toward smart cities across the world. One of the initial activities was relating to the opening of vast amounts of data from various public administrations and utility companies within a city in order to create a viable eco-system of urban services and applications. Thereby, the harvested metadata needed to be verified in terms of correctness and a corresponding level of quality had to be assured. In addition, the concept of an Open Urban Platform emerged as an overall solution for smart cities Information Communication Technology (ICT) in the sense that an abstract reference model was established and standardized, providing an overall picture of the ICT structures within a city. Within this article, we use the Open Urban Platform concept as the basics to describe and map our activities within the Open Data domain, focusing mainly on the Open Data prototype for German Open Governmental Data\u2014namely GovData.DE. Thereby, we describe our metadata harvesting and metadata quality assurance approach and discuss on lessons learned, which flow into the definition of metadata quality metrics and have the potential to lead to a corresponding standard within the Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung e.V. (DIN) German national standardization.",

        "Title": "Digital Trust and the Reconstruction of Trust in the Digital Society: An Integrated Model based on Trust Theory and Expectation Confirmation Theory",
        "Abstract": "Digital trust is born with the evolution of digital society. It is an inescapable topic in the digital society and it is developed from traditional interpersonal trust and institutional trust and has been extensively used in the Internet space. At present, the research on digital trust is rare. Based on the Trust Theory and the Expectation Confirmation Theory, this paper puts forward an integration model with user satisfaction as the intermediary variable. Besides, this paper develops a set of scales for evaluating digital trust combined with maturity scales and points out that digital trust consists of digital cognitive trust and emotional trust. This paper assumed that user perception and user expectation indirectly affect digital trust through user satisfaction and used SPSS 23.0 to do reliability, validity test, and exploratory factor analysis. The results found that user satisfaction plays a mediating role by fitting, evaluating, and optimizing the structural equation model with AMOS23.0. User satisfaction is a partial intermediary between user perception and digital trust, and it is the complete intermediary between user expectation and digital trust. These results demonstrate two things. Firstly, in the digital society, the construction of users' digital trust is based on users' satisfaction. The government should provide diversified and high-quality e-government services as far as possible. Secondly, digital trust is directly or indirectly affected by user perception and user expectation. The government should build a safe, green, and harmonious digital environment for users and make e-government services consistent with users' expectation.",

        "Abstract": "In this digital age, human dependency on technology in various fields has been increasing tremendously. Torrential amounts of different electronic products are being manufactured daily for everyday use. With this advancement in the world of Internet technology, cybersecurity of software and hardware systems are now prerequisites for major business\u2019 operations. Every technology on the market has multiple vulnerabilities that are exploited by hackers and cyber-criminals daily to manipulate data sometimes for malicious purposes. In any system, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a fundamental component for ensuring the security of devices from digital attacks. Recognition of new developing digital threats is getting harder for existing IDS. Furthermore, advanced frameworks are required for IDS to function both efficiently and effectively. The commonly observed cyber-attacks in the business domain include minor attacks used for stealing private data. This article presents a deep learning methodology for detecting cyber-attacks on the Internet of Things using a Long Short Term Networks classifier. Our extensive experimental testing show an Accuracy of 99.09%, F1-score of 99.46%, and Recall of 99.51%, respectively. A detailed metric representing our results in tabular form was used to compare how our model was better than other state-of-the-art models in detecting cyber-attacks with proficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Computer users are generally faced with difficulties in making correct security decisions. While an increasingly fewer number of people are trying or willing to take formal security training, online sources including news, security blogs, and websites are continuously making security knowledge more accessible. Analysis of cybersecurity texts from this grey literature can provide insights into the trending topics and identify current security issues as well as how cyber attacks evolve over time. These in turn can support researchers and practitioners in predicting and preparing for these attacks. Comparing different sources may facilitate the learning process for normal users by creating the patterns of the security knowledge gained from different sources. Prior studies neither systematically analysed the wide range of digital sources nor provided any standardisation in analysing the trending topics from recent security texts. Moreover, existing topic modelling methods are not capable of identifying the cybersecurity concepts completely and the generated topics considerably overlap. To address this issue, we propose a semi-automated classification method to generate comprehensive security categories to analyse trending topics. We further compare the identified 16 security categories across different sources based on their popularity and impact. We have revealed several surprising findings as follows: (1) The impact reflected from cybersecurity texts strongly correlates with the monetary loss caused by cybercrimes, (2) security blogs have produced the context of cybersecurity most intensively, and (3) websites deliver security information without caring about timeliness much.",

        "Abstract": "Online social networks provide a convenient platform for the spread of rumors, which could lead to serious aftermaths such as economic losses and public panic. The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on a one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there is more than one feature associated with an object. A user's impression on this object is determined not just by one feature but by her overall evaluation of all features associated with it. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the spread of multiple features. Based on that, we design a multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper and formulate a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure according to this model. To solve the MFRB problem, we design a creative sampling method called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to this multi-layer network structure. Then, we propose a Revised-IMM algorithm and obtain a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our Revised-IMM and its advantage to their baseline algorithms.",

        "Title": "A Federated Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Smart Buildings",
        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in smart buildings are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable. These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising the prediction performance.",

At the same time, the pervasive internet connections of these systems necessitate the fundamental design of security into these devices. The isolation of complex features from those that are critical through protection domains is an effective means to constrain the scope of faults and security breaches. Common hardware-provided memory facilities to enforce protection domains through memory access control -- including Memory Management Units (MMUs) usually found in microprocessors, and Memory Protection Units (MPUs) usually found in microcontrollers -- must meet the goals of enabling flexible, efficient and dynamic management of memory, and must enable tight bounds on the worst-case execution of critical code. Unfortunately, current system memory management facilities are ill-prepared to handle this challenge: MMUs that use extensive caches to achieve strong average-case performance suffer from debilitating worst-case and even average-case behavior under hefty interference, while MPUs struggle to provide flexible memory management.",

        "Abstract": "Synchronization primitives for fault-tolerant distributed systems that ensure an effective and efficient cooperation among processes are an important challenge in the programming languages community. We present a new programming abstraction, ReSync, for implementing benign and Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols. ReSync has a new round structure that offers a simple abstraction for group communication, like it is customary in synchronous systems, but also allows messages to be received one by one, like in the asynchronous systems. This extension allows implementing network and algorithm-specific policies for the message reception, which is not possible in classic round models.",

In addition to high utility of the joint model, rigorous privacy protection of the data and communication efficiency are important design goals.

        "Title": "Mode-Suppression: A Simple, Stable and Scalable Chunk-Sharing Algorithm for P2P Networks",
        "Abstract": "The ability of a P2P network to scale its throughput up in proportion to the arrival rate of peers has recently been shown to be crucially dependent on the chunk sharing policy employed. Some policies can result in low frequencies of a particular chunk, known as the missing chunk syndrome, which can dramatically reduce throughput and lead to instability of the system. For instance, commonly used policies that nominally &#x201C;boost&#x201D; the sharing of infrequent chunks such as the well-known rarest-first algorithm have been shown to be unstable. We take a complementary viewpoint, and instead consider a policy that simply prevents the sharing of the most frequent chunk(s), that we call mode-suppression. We also consider a more general version that suppresses the mode only if the mode frequency is larger than the lowest frequency by a fixed threshold. We prove the stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman bound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer arrival rate. We then design versions of mode-suppression that sample a small number of peers at each time, and construct noisy mode estimates by aggregating these samples over time. We show numerically that mode suppression stabilizes and outperforms all other recently proposed chunk sharing algorithms, and via integration into BitTorrent implementation operating over the ns-3 that it ensures stable, low sojourn time operation in a real-world setting.",

        "Abstract": "This paper argues that a conventional approach to cybersecurity awareness is not effective in influencing employees and creating sustainable behaviour change. The increase in security incidents caused by employees is evidence that providing information to raise employees\u2019 awareness does not necessarily result in improving their security behaviour, and organisations must transform their security awareness program to extend beyond awareness to influence and behaviour change. This paper presents an in-depth case study of Telstra a leading Australian telecommunication company with a well-resourced and mature cybersecurity influence program that evolved as a result of experience throughout the years. The paper adopts the psychological attachment theory to explain strategies (e.g. cybersecurity champion) implemented by Telstra influence team to influence employees to improve their security-related behaviour. The contribution of this paper represents the first step for a comprehensive practice-based guidance for organisations on how to transform their cybersecurity beyond awareness to influence behavioural change. This paper is based on both academic and industrial perspectives, and it provides a sound basis for future empirical work.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we argue that off-balance-sheet information is potentially useful to evaluate accounting information quality in addition to financial indicators. We propose a novel method to evaluate the accounting information quality of listed companies in China by merging four financial attributes and six indicators derived from off-balance-sheet information, where the principal component analysis is used to filter the indicators which count heavily for the evaluation. Validation and comparison are implemented on the dataset of all financial frauds and violations (5031 cases) of 1995 listed companies of Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2003 to 2017. The results show that the proposed method outperforms both the traditional \u201cDD model\u201d (Dechow and Dichev, The Accounting Review 77(1):35\u201359, 2002) and the model only involving financial indicators in identifying and predicting financial fraud of enterprises. The results highlight that off-balance-sheet information is indeed useful and important to evaluate accounting information quality.",

        "Abstract": "Terahertz (THz)-band communications have been envisioned as a key technology to support ultra-high-data-rate applications in 5G-beyond (or 6G) wireless networks. Compared to the microwave and mmWave bands, the main challenges with the THz band are in its i) large path loss hence limited network coverage and ii) visible-light-like propagation characteristics hence poor support of mobility in blockage-rich environments. This paper studies quantitatively the applicability of THz-band communications in blockage-rich mobile environments, focusing on a new network scenario called <italic>FlyTera</italic>. In <italic>FlyTera</italic>, a set of hotspots mounted on flying drones collaboratively provide data streaming services to ground users, in the microwave, mmWave and THz bands. We first provide a mathematical formulation of the <italic>FlyTera</italic> control problem, where the objective is to maximize the network spectral efficiency by jointly controlling the flight of the drone hotspots, their association to the ground users, and the spectrum bands used by the users. To solve the resulting problem, which is shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear nonconvex programming (MINLP) problem, we design distributed solution algorithms based on a combination of echo state learning and reinforcement learning. An extensive simulation campaign is then conducted with SimBAG, a newly developed <underline>Sim</underline>ulator of <underline>B</underline>roadband <underline>A</underline>erial-<underline>G</underline>round wireless networks. It is shown that no single spectrum band can meet the requirements of high data rate and wide coverage simultaneously. Moreover, from the network-level point of view, THz-band communications can significantly benefit from the mobility of the flying drones, and on average <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$4 - 6$ </tex-math></inline-formula> times <italic>higher (rather than lower)</italic> throughput can be achieved in mobile than in static environments.",

        "Title": "PFCA: A Programmable FIB Caching Architecture",
        "Abstract": "Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) chips are used to store Forwarding Information Bases (FIB) in modern routers. TCAM provides next-hop lookup for IP packets at the line-rate. However, TCAM is expensive and energy-consuming; in addition, the constant FIB growth may lead to TCAM overflow problem. Yet only a small portion of FIB entries carries the most of network traffic. Thus, FIB caching, namely, installing the most popular entries in a fast memory, e.g., TCAM, may significantly minimize TCAM usage. To date, FIB caching architecture has not been widely deployed in backbone routers due to high cache-miss latency and the lack of an efficient cache replacement strategy. In this work, we leverage the concept of the programmable data plane to design a Programmable FIB Caching Architecture (PFCA) with two levels of cache. We present a pipeline-based algorithm to detect the least popular prefixes in a cache for a victim selection. We tested the prototype of PFCA using real traffic traces and an FIB with more than 599K entries, and showed that PFCA can be implemented using P4 programmable data plane language. Our results show that PFCA achieves 99.8% hit ratio for Level-1 cache with 20K entries and nearly 99.9% hit ratio for Level-2 cache with 40K entries. We also demonstrate that PFCA significantly reduces the number of BGP updates in the cache and thus makes the cache more stable.",

        "Abstract": "Over the past 20 years, the practices of crisis preparedness, response, and recovery have become increasingly dependent on information and communication technology (ICT) to accomplish their work. More recently, crisis informatics has developed an analysis of these phenomena from social and computational perspectives. To further to assess the consequences and opportunities of technological developments in the field, we re-interpret the concept of informating, first developed by Zuboff to describe the impacts of technological changes on the workplace during the 1980s. We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.",

        "Title": "A Decision Framework to Recommend Cruising Locations for Taxi Drivers under the Constraint of Booking Information",
        "Abstract": "As the demand for taxi reservation services has increased, increasing the income of taxi drivers with advanced services has attracted attention. In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver's profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H* (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on guiding a route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers under the constraint of booking information.",

This work addresses defending against remote exploitation attacks on vulnerable IoT devices. As an attack mitigation strategy, we assume it is not possible to fix all the vulnerabilities and propose to diversify the open-source software used to manage IoT devices. Our approach is to deploy dynamic cloud-based virtual machine proxies for physical IoT devices. Our architecture leverages virtual machine proxies with diverse software configurations to mitigate vulnerable and static software configurations on physical devices. We develop an algorithm for selecting new configurations based on network anomaly detection signals to learn vulnerable software configurations on IoT devices, automatically shifting towards more secure configurations. Cloud-based proxy machines mediate requests between application clients and vulnerable IoT devices, facilitating a dynamic diversification system. We report on simulation experiments to evaluate the dynamic system. Two models of powerful adversaries are introduced and simulated against the diversified defense strategy. Our experiments show that a dynamically diversified IoT architecture can be invulnerable to large classes of attacks that would succeed against a static architecture.",

CTVM asks for the most cost-effective users to influence the most relevant users. In contrast to the vast literature, we attempt to offer exact solutions. As the problem is NP-hard, thus, exact solutions are intractable, we propose TipTop, a $1-\\epsilon$ -optimal solution for arbitrary $\\epsilon >0$ that scales to very large networks, such as Twitter. At the heart of TipTop lies an innovative technique that reduces the number of samples as much as possible. This allows us to exactly solve CTVM on a much smaller space of generated samples using integer programming. Furthermore, TipTop lends a tool for researchers to benchmark their solutions against the optimal one in large-scale networks, which is currently not available.",

        "Abstract": "Anomaly detection in communication networks is the first step in the challenging task of securing a network, as anomalies may indicate suspicious behaviors, attacks, network malfunctions, or failures. In this paper, we address the problem of not only detecting the anomalous events but also of attributing the anomaly to the flows causing it. To this end, we develop a new statistical decision theoretic framework for temporally correlated traffic in networks via Markov chain modeling. We first formulate the optimal anomaly detection problem via the generalized likelihood ratio test GLRT for our composite model. This results in a combinatorial optimization problem which is prohibitively expensive. We then develop two low-complexity anomaly detection algorithms. The first is based on the cross entropy CE method, which detects anomalies as well as attributes anomalies to flows. The second algorithm performs anomaly detection via GLRT on the aggregated flows transformation\u2014a compact low-dimensional representation of the raw traffic flows. The two algorithms complement each other and allow the network operator to first activate the flow aggregation algorithm in order to quickly detect anomalies in the system. Once an anomaly has been detected, the operator can further investigate which specific flows are anomalous by running the CE-based algorithm. We perform extensive performance evaluations and experiment our algorithms on synthetic and semi-synthetic data, as well as on real Internet traffic data obtained from the MAWI archive, and finally make recommendations regarding their usability.",

        "Title": "Integrating IoT-Sensing and Crowdsensing with Privacy: Privacy-Preserving Hybrid Sensing for Smart Cities",
        "Abstract": "Data sensing and gathering is an essential task for various information-driven services in smart cities. On the one hand, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can be deployed at certain fixed locations to capture data reliably but suffer from limited sensing coverage. On the other hand, data can also be gathered dynamically through crowdsensing contributed by voluntary users but suffer from its unreliability and the lack of incentives for users\u2019 contributions. In this article, we explore an integrated paradigm called \u201chybrid sensing\u201d that harnesses both IoT-sensing and crowdsensing in a complementary manner. In hybrid sensing, users are incentivized to provide sensing data not covered by IoT sensors and provide crowdsourced feedback to assist in calibrating IoT-sensing. Their contributions will be rewarded with credits that can be redeemed to retrieve synthesized information from the hybrid system. In this article, we develop a hybrid sensing system that supports explicit user privacy\u2014IoT sensors are obscured physically to prevent capturing private user data, and users interact with a crowdsensing server via a privacy-preserving protocol to preserve their anonymity. A key application of our system is smart parking, by which users can inquire and find the available parking spaces in outdoor parking lots. We implemented our hybrid sensing system for smart parking and conducted extensive empirical evaluations. Finally, our hybrid sensing system can be potentially applied to other information-driven services in smart cities.",

        "Title": "From False-Free to Privacy-Oriented Communitarian Microblogging Social Networks",
        "Abstract": "Online Social Networks (OSNs) have gained enormous popularity in recent years. They provide a dynamic platform for sharing content (text messages or multimedia) and for facilitating communication between friends and acquaintances. Microblogging services are a popular form of OSNs. They allow sending small messages in a one-to-many messaging model so that users can communicate with their favorite celebrity, brand, politician, or other regular users without the obligation of a pre-existing social relationship. A chain of privacy-related scandals linked to questionable data handling practices in microblogging services has arisen in the last past few years. Most current microblogging service providers offer centralized services and their business model is based on monitoring, analyzing, and selling users\u2019 activity and patterns. In the end, the personal information shared by the users to benefit from the free-of-charge services is used for the underlying payment in such systems. In this paper, we present Garlanet, a privacy-aware censorship-resistant microblogging social network that does not rely on a centralized service provider as all data is hosted in computers voluntarily contributed by the users of the system. Garlanet provides microblogging functionalities while protecting privacy and preserving the confidentiality and integrity of users and data. It ensures that users\u2019 identities and their social graphs are hidden from the system and adversaries and it provides availability and scalability of the services. We also evaluate the privacy level of Garlanet and we compare it with the privacy level of eight other microblogging systems.",

        "Abstract": "Negative samples in health and medical insurance domain refer to fraudulent or erroneous insurance claims that may include inconsistent diagnosis-procedure relations with respect to a medical coding system. Unfortunately, only a few datasets are publicly available for research in health insurance domain, yet none reports any negative claims. However, negative claims are essential not only to develop new machine learning approaches but also to test and validate automated artificial intelligence systems deployed by insurance providers. In this study, we introduce a synthetic negative claim generation procedure based on the bipartite graph representations of positive claims. Our empirical results demonstrate promising outcomes that will improve the development and evaluation processes of machine learning approaches in healthcare, where negative samples are required, but not available. Moreover, the proposed scheme can be applied to other domains, where bipartite graph representations are meaningful and negative samples are lacking.",

Various emerging applications are promising to enrich users\u2019 traveling experiences and daily life. However, how to execute computing-intensive applications on resource-constrained vehicles still faces huge challenges. In this article, we construct an intelligent offloading system for vehicular edge computing by leveraging deep reinforcement learning. First, both the communication and computation states are modelled by finite Markov chains. Moreover, the task scheduling and resource allocation strategy is formulated as a joint optimization problem to maximize users\u2019 Quality of Experience (QoE). Due to its complexity, the original problem is further divided into two sub-optimization problems. A two-sided matching scheme and a deep reinforcement learning approach are developed to schedule offloading requests and allocate network resources, respectively.

        "Title": "Extracting Routing Events From Traceroutes: A Matter of Empathy",
        "Abstract": "With the increasing diffusion of Internet probing technologies, a large amount of regularly collected traceroutes are available for Internet service providers ISPs at low cost. We show how it is possible, given solely an arbitrary set of traceroutes, to spot routing paths that change similarly over time and aggregate them into inferred routing events. With respect to previous works, our approach does not require any knowledge of the network, does not need complex integration of several data sources, and exploits the asynchronicity of measurements to accurately position events in time. The formal model at the basis of our methodology revolves around the notion of empathy, a relation that binds similarly behaving traceroutes. The correctness and completeness of our approach are based on structural properties that are easily expressed in terms of empathic measurements. We perform experiments with data from public measurement infrastructures like RIPE Atlas, showing the effectiveness of our algorithm in distilling significant events from a large amount of traceroute data. We also validate the accuracy of the inferred events against ground-truth knowledge of routing changes originating from induced and spontaneous routing events. Given these promising results, we believe that our methodology can be an effective aid for troubleshooting at the ISPs level. The source code of our algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/empadig.",

        "Abstract": "With the proliferation of mobile devices and various sensors e.g., GPS, magnetometer, accelerometers, gyroscopes equipped, richer services, e.g. location based services, are provided to users. A series of methods have been proposed to protect the users\u2019 privacy, especially the trajectory privacy. Hardware fingerprinting has been demonstrated to be a surprising and effective source for identifying/authenticating devices. In this work, we show that a few data samples collected from the motion sensors are enough to uniquely identify the source mobile device, i.e., the raw motion sensor data serves as a fingerprint of the mobile device. Specifically, we first analytically understand the fingerprinting capacity using features extracted from hardware data. To capture the essential device feature automatically, we design a multi-LSTM neural network to fingerprint mobile device sensor in real-life uses, instead of using handcrafted features by existing work. Using data collected over 6 months, for arbitrary user movements, our fingerprinting model achieves 93% F-score given one second data, while the state-of-the-art work achieves 79% F-score. Given ten seconds randomly sampled data, our model can achieve 98.8% accuracy. We also propose a novel generative model to modify the original sensor data and yield anonymized data with little fingerprint information while retain good data utility.",

        "Abstract": "To tackle the contradiction between the computation intensive applications and the resource-hungry mobile user equipments UEs, mobile edge computing MEC has been provisioned as a promising solution, which enables the UEs to offload the tasks to the MEC servers. Considering the characteristics of small cell networks SCNs, integrating MEC into SCNs is natural. But in terms of the high interference, multi-access property, and limited resources of small cell base stations SBSs, an efficient computation offloading scheme is essential. However, there still lack comprehensive studies on this problem in the densely deployed SCNs. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient computation offloading management scheme in the MEC system with SCNs. The aim of this paper is to minimize the energy consumption of all UEs via jointly optimizing computation offloading decision making, spectrum, power, and computation resource allocation. Specially, the UEs need not only to decide whether to offload but also to determine where to offload. First, we present the computation offloading model and formulate this problem as a mix integer non-linear programming problem, which is NP-hard. Taking advantages of genetic algorithm GA and particle swarm optimization PSO, we design a suboptimal algorithm named as hierarchical GA and PSO-based computation algorithm to solve this problem. Finally, the convergence of this algorithm is studied by simulation, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by comparing with the other baseline algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Network K-function has been the de facto operation for analyzing point patterns in spatial networks, which is widely used in many communities, including geography, ecology, transportation science, social science, and criminology. To analyze a location dataset, domain experts need to generate a network K-function plot that involves computing multiple network K-functions. However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions. In addition, we incorporate the advanced shortest path sharing (ASPS) approach into these two methods to further lower the worst-case time complexity for generating network K-function plots. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets (up to 7.33 million data points) show that our methods can achieve up to 165.85x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Abstract": "Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. Based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default Dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",

        "Title": "Towards Personalized Privacy-Preserving Truth Discovery Over Crowdsourced Data Streams",
        "Abstract": "Truth discovery is an effective paradigm which could reveal the truth from crowdsouced data with conflicts, enabling data-driven decision-making systems to make quick and smart decisions. The increasing privacy concern promotes users to perturb or encrypt their private data before outsourcing, which poses significant challenges for truth discovery. Although several privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanisms have been proposed, none of them take personal privacy expectation into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel personalized privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPPTD) framework over crowdsourced data streams to achieve timely and accurate truth discovery while guaranteeing the protection of individual privacy. The key challenges of PPPTD lie in improving the accuracy of truth estimation from the perturbed streaming data with personalized protection level. To address these challenges, we first develop a personalized budget initialization mechanism to quantify each user&#x2019;s privacy protection requirement, and allocate personalized privacy budgets to users according to their privacy requirements. Then we propose a deviation-aware weighted aggregation method to improve the accuracy of truth discovery from streaming data with varying degrees of perturbation. In order to achieve privacy-utility tradeoff, we further propose an influence-aware adaptive budget adjustment mechanism that adaptively re-allocates privacy budgets to users based on the evolution of their influence in the weighted aggregation.

Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PPPTD.",

        "Title": "Physical-Layer Authentication in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems",
        "Abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of authenticating the transmitter device in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This problem is important because of high vulnerabilities in wireless communications and an additional security vulnerability when some users collude with the adversary. In this paper, we consider two attacking scenarios. In the first scenario, there is no user that colludes with the adversary. In the second scenario, at least one user colludes with the adversary. In this paper, we propose an authentication approach in the down-link scheme of a NOMA system using physical-layer authentication mechanism because of its advantages: provide information theoretic security, reduce complexity, save power and allow us to construct a two-factor authentication system. Based on the aforementioned two attacking scenarios, we propose three physical-layer authentication schemes for a NOMA system: Physical-Layer Authentication with Shared Authentication Tag (PLA-SAT), Physical-Layer Authentication with Superimposed Independent authentication Tags (PLA-SIT), and Physical-Layer Authentication with TDM authentication tags (PLA-TDM). We analyze the theoretical performance of our schemes over fading channels and derive their closed-form expressions. Then, we optimize the parameters of our schemes to achieve both the reliability fairness and the authentication-accuracy fairness. We implemented our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparisons. Our experimental results show that for the first attacking scenario, the PLA-SAT scheme offers more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 10 dB. For the second attacking scenario, both the PLA-SIT scheme and the PLA-TDM scheme offer more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 12 dB.",

However, health data sharing poses several security issues, such as access control and privacy leakage, as well as faces critical challenges to obtain efficient data analysis and services. In this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fog-assisted health data sharing (PFHDS) scheme for e-healthcare systems. Specifically, we integrate the fog node to classify the shared data into different categories according to disease risks for efficient health data analysis. Meanwhile, we design an enhanced attribute-based encryption method through combination of a personal access policy on patients and a professional access policy on the fog node for effective medical service provision. Furthermore, we achieve significant encryption consumption reduction for patients by offloading a portion of the computation and storage burden from patients to the fog node. Security discussions show that PFHDS realizes data confidentiality and fine-grained access control with collusion resistance. Performance evaluations demonstrate cost-efficient encryption computation, storage and energy consumption.",

        "Abstract": "This paper presents Merlin, a framework for managing resources in software-defined networks. With Merlin, administrators express high-level policies using programs in a declarative language. The language includes logical predicates to identify sets of packets, regular expressions to encode forwarding paths, and arithmetic formulas to specify bandwidth constraints. The compiler maps these policies into a constraint problem that determines bandwidth allocations using parametrizable heuristics. It then generates a code that can be executed on the network elements to enforce the policies. To allow network tenants to dynamically adapt policies to their needs, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Experiments demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of Merlin on realistic scenarios. Overall, Merlin simplifies network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying and enforcing network policies.",

        "Title": "Spooky: granulating LSM-tree compactions correctly",
        "Abstract": "Modern storage engines and key-value stores have come to rely on the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree) as their core data structure. LSM-tree operates by gradually merge-sorting data across levels of exponentially increasing capacities in storage. A crucial design dimension of LSM-tree is its compaction granularity. Some designs perform Full Merge, whereby entire levels get compacted at once. Others perform Partial Merge, whereby smaller groups of files with overlapping key ranges are compacted independently. This paper shows that both strategies exhibit serious flaws. With Full Merge, space-amplification is exorbitant. The reason is that while compacting the LSM-tree's largest level, there must be at least twice as much storage space as data to store both the original and new files until the compaction is finished. On the other hand, Partial Merge exhibits excessive write-amplification. The reason is twofold. (1) The files getting compacted typically do not have perfectly overlapping key ranges, and so some non-overlapping data is superfluously rewritten in each compaction. (2) Files with different lifetimes become interspersed within the SSD leading to high SSD garbage-collection overheads. As the data size grows, these problems grow in magnitude.",

        "Title": "Progressive Slice Recovery With Guaranteed Slice Connectivity After Massive Failures",
        "Abstract": "In presence of multiple failures affecting their network infrastructure, operators are faced with the Progressive Network Recovery (PNR) problem, i.e., deciding the best sequence of repairs during recovery. With incoming deployments of 5G networks, PNR must evolve to incorporate new recovery opportunities offered by network slicing. In this study, we introduce the new problem of Progressive Slice Recovery (PSR), which is addressed with eight different strategies, i.e., allowing or not to change slice embedding during the recovery, and/or by enforcing different versions of slice connectivity (i.e., network vs. content connectivity). We propose a comprehensive PSR scheme, which can be applied to all recovery strategies and achieves fast recovery of slices. We first prove the PSR&#x2019;s NP-hardness and design an integer linear programming (ILP) model, which can obtain the best recovery sequence and is extensible for all the recovery strategies. Then, to address scalability issues of the ILP model, we devise an efficient two-phases progressive slice recovery (2-phase PSR) meta-heuristic algorithm, small optimality gap, consisting of two main steps: i) determination of recovery sequence, achieved through a linear-programming relaxation that works in polynomial time; and ii) slice-embedding recovery, for which we design an auxiliary-graph-based column generation to re-embed failed slice nodes/links to working substrate elements within a given number of actions. Numerical results compare the different strategies and validate that amount of recovered slices can be improved up to 50&#x0025; if operators decide to reconfigure only few slice nodes and guarantee content connectivity.",

        "Abstract": "The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in an untended environment and the openness of the wireless channel bring various security threats to WSN. The resource limitations of the sensor nodes make the conventional security systems less attractive for WSN. Moreover, conventional cryptography alone cannot ensure the desired security against the physical attacks on sensor nodes. Physically unclonable function (PUF) is an emerging hardware security primitive that provides low-cost hardware security exploiting the unique inherent randomness of a device. In this article, we have proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for the WSN integrating Pedersen\u2019s verifiable secret sharing (Pedersen\u2019s VSS) and Shamir\u2019s secret sharing (Shamir\u2019s SS) scheme with PUF which ensure the desired security with low overhead. The security analysis depicts the resilience of the proposed scheme against different active, passive and physical attacks. Also, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme possesses low computation, communication and storage overhead. The scheme only needs to store a polynomial number of PUF challenge-response pairs to the user node. The sink or senor nodes do not require storing any secret key. Finally, the comparison with the previous protocols establishes the dominance of the proposed scheme to use in WSN.",

        "Title": "Certificateless Homomorphic Signature Scheme for Network Coding",
        "Abstract": "Homomorphic signature is an extremely important public key authentication technique for network coding to defend against pollution attacks. As a public key cryptographic primitive, it also encounters the same problem of how to confirm the relationship between some public key <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$pk$ </tex-math></inline-formula> and the identity <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$ID$ </tex-math></inline-formula> of its owner. In the setting of distributed network coding, the intermediate and destination nodes need to use the public key of source node S to check the validity of vector-signature pairs. Therefore, the binding of S and its corresponding public key becomes crucial. The popular and traditional solution is based on certificates which are issued by a trusted certification authority (CA) center. However, the generation and management of certificates is extremely cumbersome. Hence, in recent work, Lin <italic>et al.</italic> proposed a new notion of identity-based homomorphic signature, which intends to avoid using certificates. But the key escrow problem is inevitable for identity-based primitives. In this article, we propose another new notion (for network coding): certificateless homomorphic signature (CLHS), which is a compromise for the above two techniques. In particular, we first describe the definition and security model of certificateless homomorphic signature. Then based on bilinear map and the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption, give a concrete implementation and detailedly analyze its security. Finally, performance analysis illustrates that our construction is practical.",

        "Abstract": "Truth discovery is an effective paradigm which could reveal the truth from crowdsouced data with conflicts, enabling data-driven decision-making systems to make quick and smart decisions. The increasing privacy concern promotes users to perturb or encrypt their private data before outsourcing, which poses significant challenges for truth discovery. Although several privacy-preserving truth discovery mechanisms have been proposed, none of them take personal privacy expectation into consideration. In this work, we propose a novel personalized privacy-preserving truth discovery (PPPTD) framework over crowdsourced data streams to achieve timely and accurate truth discovery while guaranteeing the protection of individual privacy. The key challenges of PPPTD lie in improving the accuracy of truth estimation from the perturbed streaming data with personalized protection level. To address these challenges, we first develop a personalized budget initialization mechanism to quantify each user&#x2019;s privacy protection requirement, and allocate personalized privacy budgets to users according to their privacy requirements. Then we propose a deviation-aware weighted aggregation method to improve the accuracy of truth discovery from streaming data with varying degrees of perturbation. In order to achieve privacy-utility tradeoff, we further propose an influence-aware adaptive budget adjustment mechanism that adaptively re-allocates privacy budgets to users based on the evolution of their influence in the weighted aggregation. We prove that PPPTD can achieve <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-differential privacy over the whole data generated by users and satisfy individual personalized privacy requirements.

        "Title": "Physical-Layer Authentication in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Systems",
        "Abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of authenticating the transmitter device in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. This problem is important because of high vulnerabilities in wireless communications and an additional security vulnerability when some users collude with the adversary. In this paper, we consider two attacking scenarios. In the first scenario, there is no user that colludes with the adversary. In the second scenario, at least one user colludes with the adversary. In this paper, we propose an authentication approach in the down-link scheme of a NOMA system using physical-layer authentication mechanism because of its advantages: provide information theoretic security, reduce complexity, save power and allow us to construct a two-factor authentication system. Based on the aforementioned two attacking scenarios, we propose three physical-layer authentication schemes for a NOMA system: Physical-Layer Authentication with Shared Authentication Tag (PLA-SAT), Physical-Layer Authentication with Superimposed Independent authentication Tags (PLA-SIT), and Physical-Layer Authentication with TDM authentication tags (PLA-TDM). We analyze the theoretical performance of our schemes over fading channels and derive their closed-form expressions. Then, we optimize the parameters of our schemes to achieve both the reliability fairness and the authentication-accuracy fairness. We implemented our schemes and conducted extensive performance comparisons. Our experimental results show that for the first attacking scenario, the PLA-SAT scheme offers more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 10 dB. For the second attacking scenario, both the PLA-SIT scheme and the PLA-TDM scheme offer more than 97% authentication accuracy when the received SNR of the served user with poor channel condition is at least 12 dB.",

        "Abstract": "Pervasive data collected from e-healthcare devices possess significant medical value through data sharing with professional healthcare service providers. However, health data sharing poses several security issues, such as access control and privacy leakage, as well as faces critical challenges to obtain efficient data analysis and services. In this article, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving fog-assisted health data sharing (PFHDS) scheme for e-healthcare systems. Specifically, we integrate the fog node to classify the shared data into different categories according to disease risks for efficient health data analysis. Meanwhile, we design an enhanced attribute-based encryption method through combination of a personal access policy on patients and a professional access policy on the fog node for effective medical service provision. Furthermore, we achieve significant encryption consumption reduction for patients by offloading a portion of the computation and storage burden from patients to the fog node. Security discussions show that PFHDS realizes data confidentiality and fine-grained access control with collusion resistance. Performance evaluations demonstrate cost-efficient encryption computation, storage and energy consumption.",

        "Title": "Merlin: A Language for Managing Network Resources",
        "Abstract": "This paper presents Merlin, a framework for managing resources in software-defined networks. With Merlin, administrators express high-level policies using programs in a declarative language. The language includes logical predicates to identify sets of packets, regular expressions to encode forwarding paths, and arithmetic formulas to specify bandwidth constraints. The compiler maps these policies into a constraint problem that determines bandwidth allocations using parametrizable heuristics. It then generates a code that can be executed on the network elements to enforce the policies. To allow network tenants to dynamically adapt policies to their needs, Merlin provides mechanisms for delegating control of sub-policies and for verifying that modifications made to sub-policies do not violate global constraints. Experiments demonstrate the expressiveness and effectiveness of Merlin on realistic scenarios. Overall, Merlin simplifies network administration by providing high-level abstractions for specifying and enforcing network policies.",

        "Abstract": "Network K-function has been the de facto operation for analyzing point patterns in spatial networks, which is widely used in many communities, including geography, ecology, transportation science, social science, and criminology. To analyze a location dataset, domain experts need to generate a network K-function plot that involves computing multiple network K-functions. However, network K-function is a computationally expensive operation that is not feasible to support large-scale datasets, let alone to generate a network K-function plot. To handle this issue, we develop two efficient algorithms, namely count augmentation (CA) and neighbor sharing (NS), which can reduce the worst-case time complexity for computing network K-functions. In addition, we incorporate the advanced shortest path sharing (ASPS) approach into these two methods to further lower the worst-case time complexity for generating network K-function plots. Experiment results on four large-scale location datasets (up to 7.33 million data points) show that our methods can achieve up to 165.85x speedup compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "Abstract": "Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. Based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default Dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is progressively becoming an essential aspect of daily life that can be sensed anywhere and anytime, transforming the traditional lifestyle into a high-tech one. Numerous applications in the edge are brought to life based on IoT infrastructures. Especially, edge computing has witnessed the proliferation and impact of IoT-enabled devices benefiting from the data collection and computation capabilities of IoT. However, establishing an IoT from scratch can be monetarily expensive, and leasing the existing sub-networks confronts the potentially dishonest behavior of service providers. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework of leasing edge IoT networks and analyze the influence of sub-network owners\u2019 dishonest behavior on the network. We model the interaction between the edge user and the owners of sub-networks by a Stackelberg game with a unique equilibrium, jointly analyzing the pricing and data collection mechanisms. The Primal-dual Decomposition algorithm and its theoretical analyses are provided for the corresponding strategies of the edge user and sub-network owners. Evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in the leasing model can save data collection cost up to 53% compared with existing data collection strategies, and illustrate the difference in network performance compared with the game without dishonest owners.",

        "Abstract": "Smart government (SG) is an emerging topic, which increasingly attracts attention from scholars who work in public administration, political, and information sciences. Smart city (SC) on the other hand, is an emerging and multidisciplinary domain of study. It is not clear whether the two terms SG and SC co-exist or concern different domains that interrelate and interact. The aim of this paper is to investigate the term SG; to conceptualize it with components; to define the importance of these components to the SG with their relative strengths; and to clarify its relationship with the SC term. In this respect, this paper follows a multi-method approach: a comprehensive literature review to define and conceptualize the SG, and determine its components, and a Delphi study for validating the literature findings and for calculating the relative components\u2019 strengths. The SG definitions that are in literature have several weaknesses and the authors proposed a definition to the SG that overcomes them, while a model with three rings, three dimensions and 13 components conceptualizes it. The Delphi study showed that all the SG conceptual entities are useful, and highlighted that Citizens Engagement, Economic Growth, and Accountability are more important compared to the others, but it is hard to decide about the less important component. Third, the ICT Innovation entity appears to be the most important compared to emerging technologies and data. Finally, SC and SG are indeed related but, SC is proved to be a complimentary part of the broader SG term.",

        "Abstract": "Recent advances in cryptographic approaches, such as Functional Encryption and Attribute-based Encryption and their variants, have shown significant promise for enabling public clouds to provide secure computation and storage services for users\u2019 sensitive data. A crucial component of these approaches is a third-party authority (TPA) that must be trusted to set up public parameters, provide private key service, and so on. Components of deployed cryptographic mechanisms such as the certificate authorities (CAs), which are the TPAs of the underlying PKI for the SSL/TLS protocol, have faced several types of attacks (e.g., stealthy targeted and censorship attacks), and certificate mis-issuance problems. Such practical challenges indicate that the successful deployment of newer emerging cryptographic schemes will also significantly depend on the trustworthiness of the TPAs. Furthermore, recently proposed decentralized TPA approaches that lower the threshold on the conditions required for an entity to become an authority can make the trust issue much worse. To address this issue, we propose an authority transparency framework to ensure the trustworthiness of TPAs of recent and emerging advanced cryptographic schemes. The framework includes a formal model and a secure logging-based approach to implement the framework. Further, to address the issues related to privacy, we also present a privacy-preserving authority transparency approach. We present security analysis and performance evaluation to show that authority transparency achieves the security and performance goals.",

We present LayerCode, a tagging scheme that embeds a carefully designed barcode pattern in 3D printed objects as a deliberate byproduct of the 3D printing process. The LayerCode concept is inspired by the structural resemblance between the parallel black and white bars of the standard barcode and the universal layer-by-layer approach of 3D printing. We introduce an encoding algorithm that enables the 3D printing layers to carry information without altering the object geometry. We also introduce a decoding algorithm that reads the LayerCode tag of a physical object by just taking a photo. The physical deployment of LayerCode tags is realized on various types of 3D printers, including Fused Deposition Modeling printers as well as Stereolithography based printers. Each offers its own advantages and tradeoffs. We show that LayerCode tags can work on complex, nontrivial shapes, on which all previous tagging mechanisms may fail. To evaluate LayerCode thoroughly, we further stress test it with a large dataset of complex shapes using virtual rendering. Among 4,835 tested shapes, we successfully encode and decode on more than 99% of the shapes.",

However, certification validation incurs non-trivial overhead on resource-constrained IoT devices, because it either brings long latency or large cache space. This work proposes to utilize the power of distributed caching and explores the feasibility of using the cache spaces on all IoT devices as a large pool to store validated certificates. We design a Collaborative Certificate Validation (CCV) protocol including a memory-efficient and fast locator for certificate holders, a trust model to evaluate the trustworthiness of devices, and a protocol suite for dynamic update and certificate revocation. Evaluation results show that CCV only uses less than 25% validation time and reduces &gt;90% decryption operations on each device, compared to a recent method. Malicious devices that conduct dishonest validations can be detected by the network using the proposed trust model.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its technological benefits, the Internet of Things (IoT) has cyber weaknesses due to vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine Larning (ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with promising performance. An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is prominent for cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-term and harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys that fully investigate APT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth bridging the state of the art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security challenges in IoT networks and presents well-known attacks, APT attacks, and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks. The article highlights statistical insights regarding frequently applied ML-based methods against network intrusion.

        "Abstract": "When pieces from an individual's personal information available online are connected over time and across multiple platforms, this more complete digital trace can give unintended insights into their life and opinions. In a data narrative interview study with 26 currently employed participants, we examined risks and harms to individuals and employers when others joined the dots between their online information. We discuss the themes of visibility and self-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy literacies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into people's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but of subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or (re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by showing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information to be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to individuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of privacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to what they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute to current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense making in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for interventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of combined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more proactive action about what is shared and not shared online.",

        "Title": "Efficiently Inferring Top-<italic>k</italic> Largest Monitoring Data Entries Based on Discrete Tensor Completion",
        "Abstract": "Network-wide monitoring is important for many network functions. Due to the need of sampling to reduce high measurement cost, system failure, and unavoidable data transmission loss, network monitoring systems suffer from the incompleteness of network monitoring data. Different from the traditional network monitoring data estimation problem which aims to infer all missing monitoring data entries with incomplete measurement data, we study a challenging problem of inferring the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest monitoring data entries. The recent study shows it is promising to more accurately interpolate the missing data with a 3-D tensor compared to that based on a 2-D matrix. Taking full advantage of the multilinear structures, we apply tensor completion to first recover the missing data and then find the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> data entries. To reduce the computational overhead, we propose a novel discrete tensor completion model which uses binary codes to represent the factor matrices. Based on the model, we further propose three novel techniques to speed up the whole top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> entry inference process: a discrete optimization algorithm to train the binary factor matrices, bit operations to facilitate quick missing data inference, and simplifying the finding of top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest entries with binary code partition. In our discrete tensor completion model, only one bit is needed to represent the entry in the factor matrices instead of a real value (32 bits) needed in traditional tensor completion model, thus the storage cost is reduced significantly. To quickly infer the top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> largest data entries when measurement data arrive sequentially, we also propose a sliding window based online algorithm using the discrete tensor completion model. Extensive experiments using five real data sets and one synthetic data set demonstrate that compared with the state of art tensor completion algorithms, our discrete tensor completion algorithm can achieve similar top-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$k$ </tex-math></inline-formula> entry inference accuracy using significantly smaller time and storage space.",

        "Abstract": "We carry on investigating the line of research questioning the power of randomization for the design of distributed algorithms. In their seminal paper, Naor and Stockmeyer [STOC 1993] established that, in the context of network computing in which all nodes execute the same algorithm in parallel, any construction task that can be solved locally by a randomized Monte-Carlo algorithm can also be solved locally by a deterministic algorithm. This result, however, holds only for distributed tasks such that the correctness of their solutions can be locally checked by a deterministic algorithm. In this article, we extend the result of Naor and Stockmeyer to a wider class of tasks. Specifically, we prove that the same derandomization result holds for every task such that the correctness of their solutions can be locally checked using a 2-sided error randomized Monte-Carlo algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Many applications such as smart metering and location based services pose strong privacy requirements but achieving privacy protection at the client side is a non-trial problem as payment for the services must be computed by the server at the end of each billing period. In this paper, we propose a privacy preservation and billing scheme termed PPDIR based on delayed information release. PPDIR relies on a novel group signature mechanism and the asymmetric Rabin cryptosystem to protect the privacy of the clients and their requests, to achieve accountability and non-repudiation, and to shift the computational complexity to the server side. It adopts a secret token for anonymity and the token is updated for each client at the beginning of each billing period and securely released only to the server at the end of the billing period. Such a strategy can prevent the server from linking a client&#x2019;s requests made at different billing periods. It also prevents any adversary from linking any request to any client. Note that the server is able to figure out all requests made by a client within a billing period after receiving the delayed token, which is unavoidable for billing purpose. We prove the security properties of the group signature scheme, and analyze the security strength of PPDIR. Our study indicates that PPDIR can achieve privacy-preservation, confidentiality, non-repudiation, accountability, and other security objectives. We also evaluate the performance of our scheme in terms of communication and computational overheads.",

        "Abstract": "The Internet-of-Things IoT has inspired numerous new applications ever since its invention. Nevertheless, its development and utilization have always been restricted by the limited resources in various application scenarios. In this paper, we study the problem of resource provisioning for real-time IoT applications, i.e., applications that process concurrent data streams from data sources in the network. We investigate joint application placement and data routing to support IoT applications that have both quality-of-service and robustness requirements. We formulate four versions of the provisioning problem, spanning across two important classes of real-time applications parallelizable and non-parallelizable, and two provisioning scenarios single application and multiple applications. All versions are proved to be NP-hard. We propose fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for three of the four versions, and a randomized algorithm for the forth. Through simulation experiments, we analyze the impact of parallelizability and robustness on the provisioning performance, and show that our proposed algorithms can greatly improve the quality-of-service of the IoT applications.",

        "Abstract": "Students\u2019 lives, both in and out of school, are full of different forms of value. Wealthy students enjoy value in the form of financial capital; their fit to hegemonic social practices; excellent health care and so on. Low-income students, especially those from African American, Native American, and Latinx communities, often lack access to those resources. But there are other forms of value that low-income students do possess. Most examples of what we will call Counter-Hegemonic Practice (CHP) in the African American community involve some mixture of Indigenous African heritage, contemporary innovation in the Black community, and other influences. Moving between these value forms and the computing classroom is a non-trivial task, especially if we are to avoid merely using the appearance of culture to attract students. Our objective in this paper is to provide a framework for deeper investigations into the computational potentials for CHP; its potential as a link between education and community development; and a more dignified role for its utilization in the CS classroom. We report on a series of collaborative engagements with CHP, largely focused on African American communities.",

In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate EdgeLSTM, a unified data-driven system to enhance IoT computing at the network edge. The EdgeLSTM leverages the grid long short-term memory (Grid LSTM) to provide an agile solution for both deep and sequential computation, therefore can address important features such as large-scale, variety, time dependency and real time in IoT data. Our system exploits the advantages of Grid LSTM network and extends it with a multiclass support vector machine by rigorous regularization and optimization approaches, which not only has strong prediction capability of time series data, but also achieves fine-grained multiple classification through the predictive error. We deploy the EdgeLSTM into four IoT applications, including data prediction, anomaly detection, network maintenance and mobility management by extensive experiments. Our evaluation results of real-world time series data with different short-term and long-term time dependency from these typical IoT applications show that our EdgeLSTM system can guarantee robust performance in IoT computing.",

        "Abstract": "Data exchange between organizations is becoming an increasingly significant issue due to the great opportunities it presents. However, there is great reluctance to share if data sovereignty is not provided. Providing it calls for not only access control but also usage control implemented in distributed systems. Access control is a research field where there has been a great deal of work, but usage control, especially implemented in distributed systems as Distributed Usage Control (DUC), is a very new field of research that presents great challenges. Moreover, little is known about what challenges must really be faced and how they must be addressed. This is evidenced by the fact that existing research has focused non-specifically on different features of DUC, which are not formalized. Therefore, the path for the development of DUC solutions is unclear and it is difficult to analyze the scope of data sovereignty attained by the wide range of DUC solutions. In this context, this article is based on an initial in-depth analysis of DUC related work. In it, the challenges posed by DUC in terms of data sovereignty and the features that must be provided to address them are identified and analyzed for the first time. Based on these features, an initial DUC framework is proposed to assess in a practical and unified way the extent to which DUC solutions provide data sovereignty. Finally, the assessment framework is applied to compare the scopes of the most widespread DUC solutions and identify their limitations.",

        "Title": "Semantic-aware Spatio-temporal App Usage Representation via Graph Convolutional Network",
        "Abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid proliferation of personalized mobile Apps, which poses a pressing need for user experience improvement. A promising solution is to model App usage by learning semantic-aware App usage representations which can capture the relation among time, locations and Apps. However, it is non-trivial due to the complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity characteristics of App usage. To smooth over these obstacles and achieve the goal, we propose SA-GCN, a novel representation learning model to map Apps, location, and time units into dense embedding vectors considering spatio-temporal characteristics and unit properties simultaneously. To handle complexity and dynamics, we build an App usage graph by regarding App, time, and location units as nodes and their co-occurrence relations as edges. For heterogeneity, we develop a Graph Convolutional Network with meta path-based objective function to combine the structure of the graph and the attribute of units into the semantic-aware representations. We evaluate the performance of SA-GCN via a large-scale real-world dataset. In-depth analysis shows that SA-GCN characterizes the complex relationships among different units and recover meaningful spatio-temporal patterns. Moreover, we make use of the learned representations in App usage prediction task without post-training and achieve 8.3% of the performance gain compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "Title": "Two-Stage Competitive Particle Swarm Optimization Based Timing-Driven X-Routing for IC Design Under Smart Manufacturing",
        "Abstract": "As timing delay becomes a critical issue in chip performance, there is a burning desire for IC design under smart manufacturing to optimize the delay. As the best connection model for multi-terminal nets, the wirelength and the maximum source-to-sink pathlength of the Steiner minimum tree are the decisive factors of timing delay for routing. In addition, considering that X-routing can get the utmost out of routing resources, this article proposes a Timing-Driven X-routing Steiner Minimum Tree (TD-XSMT) algorithm based on two-stage competitive particle swarm optimization. This work utilizes the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and redesigns its framework, thus improving its performance. First, a two-stage learning strategy is presented, which balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the particle by learning edge structures and pseudo-Steiner point choices. Especially in the second stage, a hybrid crossover strategy is designed to guarantee convergence quality. Second, the competition mechanism is adopted to select particle learning objects and enhance diversity. Finally, according to the characteristics of the discrete TD-XSMT problem, the mutation and crossover operators of the genetic algorithm are used to effectively discretize the proposed algorithm. Experimental results reveal that TSCPSO-TD-XSMT can obtain a smooth trade-off between wirelength and maximum source-to-sink pathlength, and achieve distinguished timing delay optimization.",

        "Abstract": "Data isolation has become an obstacle to scale up query processing over big data, since sharing raw data among data owners is often prohibitive due to security concerns. A promising solution is to perform secure queries over a federation of multiple data owners leveraging secure multi-party computation (SMC) techniques, as evidenced by recent federation work over relational data. However, existing solutions are highly inefficient on spatial queries due to excessive secure distance operations for query processing and their usage of general-purpose SMC libraries for secure operation implementation. In this paper, we propose Hu-Fu, the first system for efficient and secure spatial query processing on a data federation. The idea is to decompose the secure processing of a spatial query into as many plaintext operations and as few secure operations as possible, where fewer secure operators are involved and all secure operators are implemented dedicatedly. As a working system, Hu-Fu supports not only query input in native SQL, but also heterogeneous spatial databases (e.g., PostGIS, Simba, GeoMesa, and SpatialHadoop) at the backend. Extensive experiments show that Hu-Fu usually outperforms the state-of-the-arts in running time and communication cost while guaranteeing security.",

        "Abstract": "5G NR is designed to operate over a broad range of frequency bands and support new applications with ultra-low latency requirements. To support its extremely diverse operating conditions, multiple OFDM numerologies have been defined in the 5G standards. Under these numerologies, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim 100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. This requirement poses a new challenge beyond existing LTE and cannot be satisfied by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF&#x002B;, which is a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler with timing performance under <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. GPF&#x002B; is an improvement over our GPF in Huang <italic>et al.</italic> (2018). The key ideas include decomposing the original scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF&#x002B; on an off-the-shelf NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, we show that GPF&#x002B; is able to achieve near-optimal PF performance with timing performance under <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$100 \\mathrm {\\mu s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>.

        "Abstract": "BGP reconvergence events involving a large number of prefixes may result in the loss of large amounts of traffic. Based on the observation that a very small number of prefixes carries the vast majority of traffic, we propose Power Prefixes Prioritization (PPP) to ensure the routes of these popular BGP prefixes converge first. By doing so, we significantly reduce the amount of traffic lost during reconvergence events. To achieve this, PPP obtains an ordered list of popular prefixes through traffic inspection, and configures the resulting prefix rank in the BGP routers to prioritize the processing and advertisement of BGP routes. We model the benefits of PPP over traditional BGP processing in terms of traffic loss for both generic and a Zipf traffic distribution, and we consider the impact of sampling in the process of obtaining the prefix rank. Applying the mechanism to real traffic traces obtained from WIDE, we show that PPP reduces the amount of traffic lost by an order of magnitude, even when we configure it to use conservative sampling rates. We prototype our proposal in Quagga to show the feasibility of its implementation, and we observe similar traffic loss reduction. PPP can be deployed incrementally, as it is implemented purely as a change in the router-internal BGP processing behavior.",

The structural graph clustering algorithm (SCAN) is a widely used graph clustering algorithm that derives not only clustering results, but also special roles of vertices like hubs and outliers. In this paper, we consider structural graph clustering on dynamic graphs under Jaccard similarity. The state-of-the-art index-based solution focuses on static graphs and incurs prohibitive update costs to maintain indices. Lately, an efficient approximate dynamic structural graph clustering algorithm Dyn-StrClu under Jaccard similarity is proposed. However, their solution needs to fix input parameters while parameter settings of SCAN usually need to be fine-tuned to achieve good clustering results.",

        "Abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing is a new paradigm in which a requester can recruit a group of mobile users via a platform and coordinate them to perform some sensing tasks by using their smartphones. In mobile crowdsensing, each user might perform multiple tasks with different sensing qualities. Meanwhile, the users participating in the crowdsensing will ask for sufficient rewards to compensate for their expenditures. Hence, an important problem is how to recruit the users with minimum cost while achieving a satisfactory sensing quality for each task. Furthermore, in order to ease users&#x2019; worries about privacy disclosures, the user recruitment process needs to protect each user&#x2019;s sensing quality and recruitment cost information from being revealed to other users or to the platform. In this paper, we propose two secure user recruitment problems for the cases where the recruitment costs of users are homogeneous and heterogeneous. After proving the NP-hardness of the problems, we design two secure user recruitment protocols by using secret sharing scheme. Both of the proposed protocols adopt greedy strategies, which can recruit nearly optimal users while ensuring that the total sensing quality of each task is no less than a given threshold. The difference lies in that the two greedy strategies are based on two unique utility functions. We analyze the approximation ratios of the two protocols and prove the security under the semi-honest model. Finally, we demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed protocols through extensive simulations and executions on real smartphones.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, network function virtualization has been proposed to transform from network hardware appliances to software middleboxes. Normally, a demand needs to invoke several virtual network functions VNFs following the order determined by the service chain along a routing path. In this paper, we study the joint problem of the VNF placement and path selection to better utilize the network. We discover that the relation between the link and server usage plays a crucial role in the problem. Inspired by stress testing, we first propose a systematic way to elastically tune the link and server usage of each demand based on the network status and properties of demands. In particular, we compute a proper routing path length, and decide, for each VNF in the service chain, whether to use additional server resources or to reuse resources provided by existing servers. We then propose a chain deployment algorithm that follows the guidance of this link and server usage. Via simulations, we show that our design effectively adapts resource allocation to network dynamics and, hence, serves more demands than other heuristics.",

        "Abstract": "The shared nature of the wireless medium induces contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgment. The current way of TCP acknowledgment induces control overhead which is counter-productive for TCP performance especially in wireless local area network (WLAN) scenarios. In this paper, we present a new acknowledgment called TACK (&#x201C;Tame ACK&#x201D;), as well as its TCP implementation TCP-TACK. TACK seeks to minimize ACK frequency, which is exactly what is required by transport. TCP-TACK works on top of commodity WLAN, delivering high wireless transport goodput with minimal control overhead in the form of ACKs, without any hardware modification. Evaluation results show that TCP-TACK achieves significant advantages over legacy TCP in WLAN scenarios due to less contention between data packets and ACKs. Specifically, TCP-TACK reduces over 90&#x0025; of ACKs and also obtains an improvement of up to 28&#x0025; on goodput. A TACK-based protocol is a good replacement of the legacy TCP to compensate for scenarios where the acknowledgment overhead is non-negligible.",

        "Abstract": "Owing to its nature of scalability and privacy by design, federated learning (FL) has received increasing interest in decentralized deep learning. FL has also facilitated recent research on upscaling and privatizing personalized recommendation services, using on-device data to learn recommender models locally. These models are then aggregated globally to obtain a more performant model, while maintaining data privacy. Typically, federated recommender systems (FRSs) do not take into account the lack of resources and data availability at the end-devices. In addition, they assume that the interaction data between users and items is i.i.d. and stationary across end-devices (i.e., users), and that all local recommender models can be directly averaged without considering the user\u2019s behavioral diversity. However, in real scenarios, recommendations have to be made on end-devices with sparse interaction data and limited resources. Furthermore, users\u2019 preferences are heterogeneous and they frequently visit new items. This makes their personal preferences highly skewed, and the straightforwardly aggregated model is thus ill-posed for such non-i.i.d. data. In this paper, we propose Resource Efficient Federated Recommender System (ReFRS) to enable decentralized recommendation with dynamic and diversified user preferences. On the device side, ReFRS consists of a lightweight self-supervised local model built upon the variational autoencoder for learning a user\u2019s temporal preference from a sequence of interacted items. On the server side, ReFRS utilizes a scalable semantic sampler to adaptively perform model aggregation within each identified cluster of similar users. The clustering module operates in an asynchronous and dynamic manner to support efficient global model update and cope with shifting user interests. As a result, ReFRS achieves superior performance in terms of both accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated by comparative experiments on real datasets.",

        "Title": "Bridging the Gap Between Ethics and Practice: Guidelines for Reliable, Safe, and Trustworthy Human-centered AI Systems",
        "Abstract": "This article attempts to bridge the gap between widely discussed ethical principles of Human-centered AI (HCAI) and practical steps for effective governance. Since HCAI systems are developed and implemented in multiple organizational structures, I propose 15 recommendations at three levels of governance: team, organization, and industry. The recommendations are intended to increase the reliability, safety, and trustworthiness of HCAI systems: (1) reliable systems based on sound software engineering practices, (2) safety culture through business management strategies, and (3) trustworthy certification by independent oversight. Software engineering practices within teams include audit trails to enable analysis of failures, software engineering workflows, verification and validation testing, bias testing to enhance fairness, and explainable user interfaces. The safety culture within organizations comes from management strategies that include leadership commitment to safety, hiring and training oriented to safety, extensive reporting of failures and near misses, internal review boards for problems and future plans, and alignment with industry standard practices. The trustworthiness certification comes from industry-wide efforts that include government interventions and regulation, accounting firms conducting external audits, insurance companies compensating for failures, non-governmental and civil society organizations advancing design principles, and professional organizations and research institutes developing standards, policies, and novel ideas. The larger goal of effective governance is to limit the dangers and increase the benefits of HCAI to individuals, organizations, and society.",

        "Title": "GLP: A Novel Framework for Group-Level Location Promotion in Geo-Social Networks",
        "Abstract": "Location-aware viral marketing is crucial in modern commercial applications for attracting customers to certain points of interests. Prior works are mainly based on formulating it into a location-aware influence maximization problem in Geo-social Networks GSNs, where $K$ initial seed individuals are selected in hope of maximizing the number of final influenced users. In this paper, we present the first look into the group-level location promotion, which can potentially enhance its performance, with the phenomenon that users belonging to the same geo-community share similar moving preferences. We propose GLP, a new and novel framework of group-level location promotion by virtue of geo-communities, each of which is treated as a group in GSNs. Aiming to attract more users to designated locations, GLP firstly carries out user grouping through an iterative learning approach based on information extraction from massive check-ins records. The advantage of GLP is three-folded: i by aggregating movements of group members, GLP significantly avoids the sparsity and sporadicity of individual check-ins, and thus obtains more reliable mobility models; ii by generalizing a new group-level social graph, GLP can exponentially reduce the computational complexity of seed nodes selection that is algorithmically executed by a greedy algorithm; iii in comparison with prior individual-level cases, GLP is theoretically demonstrated to drastically increase influence spread under the same given budget. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the GLP outperforms four baselines, with notably up to 10 times larger influence spread and 100 times faster seed selection over two individual-level cases, meanwhile verifying the impact of group numbers in final influence spread.",

        "Title": "Characterizing Alternative Monetization Strategies on YouTube",
        "Abstract": "One of the key emerging roles of the YouTube platform is providing creators the ability to generate revenue from their content and interactions. Alongside tools provided directly by the platform, such as revenue-sharing from advertising, creators co-opt the platform to use a variety of off-platform monetization opportunities. In this work, we focus on studying and characterizing these alternative monetization strategies. Leveraging a large longitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of alternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to detect their usage automatically. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these strategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive and increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels using one such strategy at least once. Second, we show that the adoption of these strategies varies substantially among channels of different kinds and popularity, and that channels that establish these alternative revenue streams often become more productive on the platform. Lastly, we investigate how potentially problematic channels -- those that produce Alt-lite, Alt-right, and Manosphere content -- leverage alternative monetization strategies, finding that they employ a more diverse set of such strategies significantly more often than a carefully chosen comparison set of channels. This finding complicates YouTube's role as a gatekeeper, since the practice of excluding policy-violating content from its native on-platform monetization may not be effective. Overall, this work provides an important step toward broadening the understanding of the monetary incentives behind content creation on YouTube.",

        "Abstract": "Communication technologies have significant social impacts, and it is important to consider how designers' and developers' values shape their design. Increasingly, these technologies are released as continually evolving platforms and services, so their development involves ongoing discussions and debates about unforeseen problems and future directions. However, there is a gap in research about how designers, developers, and other stakeholders engage with values during later stages of development. We investigate discussions about values in the context of open source software development, focusing on projects related to the Decentralized Web. We conducted a large-scale analysis of GitHub issues among diverse yet ideologically-related projects. We show that the percentage of discussions about values increases later in development, and we identify features and outcomes of conflicts related to open source participants' values. Finally, we propose suggestions to improve upon existing discussion practices by supporting common ground among collaborators with diverse goals, perspectives, and experiences.",

        "Title": "Modeling, Analysis and Validation of Evolving Networks With Hybrid Interactions",
        "Abstract": "In many real-world networks, entities of different types usually form an evolving network with hybrid interactions. However, how to theoretically model such networks, along with quantitive characterizations, remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving model, which, as validated by our empirical results, can well capture some basic properties such as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter, and community structure embodied in most real datasets. Particularly, two types of results are presented in this paper. First, our proposed model, namely, evolving K-Graph, consists of $K$ -node sets representing $K$ different types of entities. The hybrid interactions among entities, based on whether they belong to the same type, are classified into inter-type and intra-type ones that are, respectively, characterized by two joint graphs evolving over time. Following our newly proposed mechanism called interactive-evolution, potential connections can be established among nodes with common features and further form a positive feedback. The superiorities of our model are three folded: good capture of realistic networks, mathematical tractability, and efficient implementation. Second, by analytical derivations, along with empirical validation on real datasets, we disclose two aspects of network properties: basic ones as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter and community structure, as well as a distinctive one, that is, positive correlation observed in real networks, implying that a hub in one inter-type relationship network also has many neighbors in another one. An additional interesting finding is that through further comparison of models with or without interactive-evolution, the former one leads to an even earlier occurrence of network connectivity.",

We provide an approach for representing the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that appear in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports and the relationships among them as provenance queries that capture the attacker\u2019s malicious behavior. We use the kernel audit log as a reliable source for system activities and develop an optimized whole system provenance graph that provides the causal relationships and information flows among system entities in a compact format. Then, we model the threat hunting as a behavior match problem by applying provenance queries to the optimized provenance graph to find any hits as indicators of an APT attack. We evaluate APTHunter on adversarial engagements from DARPA over different OS platforms, as well as real-world APT campaigns. Based on our experimental results, APTHunter promptly and reliably detects attack artifacts in early stages.",

        "Abstract": "The Sketch is a compact data structure useful for network measurements. However, to cope with the high speeds of the current data plane, it needs to be held in the small on-chip memory (SRAM). Therefore, the product of the counter size and the number of counters must be below a certain limit. With small counters, some will overflow. With large counters, the total number of counters will be small, but each counter will be shared by more flows, leading to poor accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a generic technique: <italic>self-adaptive counters (SEAD Counter)</italic>. When the value of the counter is small, it works as a standard counter. When the value of the counter is large however, we increment it using a predefined probability, so as to represent this large value. Moreover, in the SEAD Counter, the probability decreases when the value increases. We show that this technique can significantly improve the accuracy of counters. This technique can be adapted to different circumstances. We theoretically analyze the improvements achieved by the SEAD Counter. We further show that our SEAD Counter can be extended to three typical sketches and Bloom filters. We conduct extensive experiments on three real datasets and one synthetic dataset. The experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art, sketches using the SEAD Counter improve the accuracy by up to 13.6 times, while the Bloom filters using SEAD Counter can reduce the false positive rate by more than one order of magnitude.",

        "Abstract": "In networks where massive sources make observations of same entities, we intend to seek the <italic>truth</italic> &#x2013; the most trustworthy value of each entity from conflicting information claimed by multiple sources. Various methods are proposed for accurately inferring both source reliability and truths, yet relying heavily on centralized settings that incur tremendous overhead to source side. In this paper, we offer a <italic>decentralized</italic> design of truth discovery task that can fit favorably to the environments with limited resources. Considering that sources forming the connected network and making individual observations, we undertake the joint maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of truth and source reliability. Our decentralization framework simply allows each source to maintain local information exchange at a time, and computes very basic functions of data observations. To this end, we facilitate the decentralization by simplifying the MLE problem into optimizing an objective function. Upon the proof of NP-hardness, two proposed decentralized algorithms (exact and approximation) are decentralized and randomized via a combination of algorithms from their centralized counterparts that ensure performance guarantee. The derived time complexity features explicit data/network dependent terms, which leads to further acceleration in truth finding. Remarkably, in two well connected networks like random geometric and preferential attachment graphs, the accelerated approximation method enjoys logarithmic time complexity while preserving comparable accuracy to the centralized counterparts. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralizations are further empirically confirmed.",

        "Abstract": "Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) cannot cope with the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Due to their high false-positive rate and the required effort of security experts to validate them, incidents can remain undetected for up to several months. As a result, enterprises suffer from data loss and severe financial damage. Recent research explored data provenance for Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) as one promising data source to tackle this issue. Data provenance represents information flows between system entities as Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG). Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDS) utilize data provenance to enhance the detection performance of intrusions and reduce false-alarm rates compared to traditional IDS. This survey demonstrates the potential of PIDS by providing a detailed evaluation of recent research in the field, proposing a novel taxonomy for PIDS, discussing current issues, and potential future research directions. This survey aims to help and motivate researchers to get started in the field of PIDS by tackling issues of data collection, graph summarization, intrusion detection, and developing real-world benchmark datasets.",

        "Title": "Fuzzing: A Survey for Roadmap",
        "Abstract": "Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth. This survey can be a roadmap for both beginners and advanced developers to better understand fuzzing.",

        "Title": "Cybersecurity of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems: A Review",
        "Abstract": "Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the \u201cphysics\u201d data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding the outputs of these reports. While these reports show that the most exploited vulnerabilities occur due to weak boundary protection, these vulnerabilities also occur due to limited or ill-defined security policies. However, current literature focuses on intrusion detection systems (IDSs), network traffic analysis (NTA) methods, or anomaly detection techniques. Hence, finding a solution for the problems mentioned in these reports is relatively hard. We bridge this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. Finally, we identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.",

        "Abstract": "Social media embeddedness relationships consist of online social networks formed by self-organized individual actors and significantly affect many aspects of our lives. Since the high cost and inefficiency of using population networks generated by social media embeddedness relationships to study practical issues, sampling techniques have become increasingly important than ever. Our work consists of three parts. We first comprehensively analyze current sampling selection methods, evaluation indexes, and evaluation methods in terms of technological evolution. In the second part, we systematically conduct sampling tests using representative large-scale social media datasets. The test results indicate that unequal-probability sampling methods can construct similar sample networks at the macroscale and microscale and outperform the equal-probability methods. However, non-negligible sampling errors at the mesoscale seriously affect the sampling reliability and validity. MANOVA tests show that the direct cause of sampling errors is the low in-degree nodes with medium-high betweenness located between the core and periphery, and current sampling methods cannot accurately sample such complex interconnected structures. In the third part, we summarize the pros and cons of current sampling methods and provide suggestions for future work.",

        "Abstract": "The appetite for effective use of information assets has been steadily rising in both public and private sector organisations. However, whether the information is used for social good or commercial gain, there is a growing recognition of the complex socio-technical challenges associated with balancing the diverse demands of regulatory compliance and data privacy, social expectations and ethical use, business process agility and value creation, and scarcity of data science talent. In this vision paper, we present a series of case studies that highlight these interconnected challenges, across a range of application areas. We use the insights from the case studies to introduce Information Resilience, as a scaffold within which the competing requirements of responsible and agile approaches to information use can be positioned. The aim of this paper is to develop and present a manifesto for Information Resilience that can serve as a reference for future research and development in relevant areas of responsible data management.",

        "Title": "Towards a unified proof framework for automated fixpoint reasoning using matching logic",
        "Abstract": "Automation of fixpoint reasoning has been extensively studied for various mathematical structures, logical formalisms, and computational domains, resulting in specialized fixpoint provers for heaps, for streams, for term algebras, for temporal properties, for program correctness, and for many other formal systems and inductive and coinductive properties. However, in spite of great theoretical and practical interest, there is no unified framework for automated fixpoint reasoning. Although several attempts have been made, there is no evidence that such a unified framework is possible, or practical. In this paper, we propose a candidate based on matching logic, a formalism recently shown to theoretically unify the above mentioned formal systems. Unfortunately, the (Knaster-Tarski) proof rule of matching logic, which enables inductive reasoning, is not syntax-driven. Worse, it can be applied at any step during a proof, making automation seem hopeless. Inspired by recent advances in automation of inductive proofs in separation logic, we propose an alternative proof system for matching logic, which is amenable for automation. We then discuss our implementation of it, which although not superior to specialized state-of-the-art automated provers for specific domains, we believe brings some evidence and hope that a unified framework for automated reasoning is not out of reach.",

        "Title": "Towards Digitization of Collaborative Savings Among Low-Income Groups",
        "Abstract": "Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) is a mechanism of informal collaborative savings that is widely used across the globe. Despite its popularity and prevalence, it is not well-studied from HCI and CSCW perspectives. The global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based Digital Financial Services (DFS) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any DFS-based interventions around ROSCAs. In this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and opportunities for their digitization in the Pakistani context. We also present a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. The platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. We present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups). We find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional ROSCAs by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. It also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility.",

        "Title": "Another Look at Privacy-Preserving Automated Contact Tracing",
        "Abstract": "In the current COVID-19 pandemic, manual contact tracing has been proven to be very helpful to reach close contacts of infected users and slow down spread of the virus. To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have been proposed, and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this article, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability, and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing Bluetooth Low Energy based ACT solutions, including centralized and decentralized ones. In addition, we examine the existing venue-based ACT solutions and identify their privacy and security concerns. Then, we propose a generic venue-based ACT solution and a concrete instantiation based on Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Our solution monitors users\u2019 contacting history only in virus-spreading-prone venues and offers higher-level protection for both security and privacy than its predecessors. Finally, we evaluate our solution from security, privacy, and efficiency perspectives, and also highlight how to reduce false positives in some specific indoor environments.",

        "Title": "Learning semantic program embeddings with graph interval neural network",
        "Abstract": "Learning distributed representations of source code has been a challenging task for machine learning models. Earlier works treated programs as text so that natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such approaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by source code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn embeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous (i.e. do not take advantage of the program-specific graph characteristics) and expensive (i.e. require heavy information exchange among nodes in the graph) message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues, especially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this paper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural Network (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained through an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular, GINN focuses exclusively on intervals (generally manifested in looping construct) for mining the feature representation of a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling the learning to large graphs.",

They extend finite-state automata with clocks, that constrain the system behavior in locations, and to take transitions. While timed automata were originally designed for safety (in the wide sense of correctness w.r.t. a formal property), they were progressively used in a number of works to guarantee security properties. In this work, we review works studying security properties for timed automata over the past two decades. We notably review theoretical works, with a particular focus on opacity, as well as more practical works, with a particular focus on attack trees and their extensions. We derive main conclusions concerning open perspectives, as well as tool support.",

        "Title": "A Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Funder Trust and Due Diligence Processes in Online Crowdfunding Investment",
        "Abstract": "We report on two studies undertaken to establish the factors that affect funders\u2019 trust and likelihood to invest in crowdfunding campaigns online. Findings from an initial small-scale qualitative study are reported and subsequently triangulated in a larger quantitative survey. Across these studies, we demonstrate the importance of social information within the peer economy, with a strong reliance on other users across the course of the investment decision-making process. Decision making on whether to invest is informed not only by the content of the crowdfunding campaign page but also by social influence factors that are present (e.g., liking of the campaigner, reciprocity). It is further shaped by due diligence checks focused on the progression of the prototype for which funding is sought, and by assurances from outside the campaign page\u2014namely on social media. Such assurances center around the importance of social proof, garnered through opinions of previous customers or other funders. The risk here is that much of this information is content that can be faked, and as such a reliance on this may leave potential funders vulnerable. Meanwhile, a genuine lack of prior experience and customer base means that some legitimate campaigners struggle to gain trust from potential investors who are reliant on such social information. Our findings present an empirical grounding to develop future security solutions that (1) protect existing funders and (2) increase potential funders\u2019 level of trust, to encourage their engagement with legitimate crowdfunding campaigns.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.",

        "Abstract": "Devices such as phones, laptops and tablets have become central to the ways in which many people communicate with others, conduct business and spend their leisure time. This type of product uniquely contains both physical and digital components that affect how they are perceived and valued by users. This article investigates the nature of attachment in the context of technological possessions to better understand ways in which designers can create devices that are meaningful and kept for longer. Findings from our study of the self-reported associations and meaningfulness of technological possessions revealed that the digital contents of these possessions were often the primary source of meaning. Technological possessions were frequently perceived as systems of products rather than as singular devices. We identified several design opportunities for materialising the associations ascribed to the digital information contained within technological products to more meaningfully integrate their physical and digital components.",

        "Title": "Understanding Human-Machine Networks: A Cross-Disciplinary Survey",
        "Abstract": "In the current hyperconnected era, modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people interact with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and participatory role. Such Human-Machine Networks (HMNs) are embedded in the daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs. Moreover, we discuss risks associated with HMNs and identify emerging design and development trends.",

Multiple reputation-related indicators are considered in a layer-based framework to implicitly reflect the reputation of the component services. The importance of an indicator on the future performance of a component service is learned using a modified Random Forest algorithm. We propose a topology-aware Forest Deep Neural Network (fDNN) to find the correlations between the reputation of a composite service and reputation indicators of component services. The trained fDNN model predicts the reputation of a new composite service with the confidence value. Experimental results with real-world dataset prove the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging technology for computer networks that uses open protocols for controlling switches and routers placed at the network edges by using specialized open programmable interfaces. In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies. By emphasizing the available state-of-the-art techniques, an extensive review of the advancement of SDN security is provided to the research and IT communities.",

        "Abstract": "Botnets account for a substantial portion of cybercrime. Botmasters utilize darkweb marketplaces to promote and provide their services, which can vary from renting or buying a botnet (or parts of it), to hiring services (e.g. distributed denial of service attacks). At the same time, botnet takedown attempts have proven to be challenging, demanding a combination of technical and legal methods, and often requiring the collaboration of a plethora of entities with varying jurisdictions. In this article, we map the elements associated with the business aspect of botnets, and utilize them to develop adaptations of two widely used business models. Furthermore, we analyze the 28 most notable botnet takedown operations carried out over from 2008 to 2021, in regard to the methods employed, and illustrate the correlation between these methods and the segments of our adapted business models. Our analysis suggests that the botnet takedown methods have been mainly focused on the technical side, but not on the botnet economic components. We aim to shed light on new takedown vectors and incentivize takedown actors to expand their efforts to methods oriented more towards the business side of botnets, which could contribute towards eliminating some of the challenges that surround takedown operations.",

        "Title": "Cyberattacks and Countermeasures for In-Vehicle Networks",
        "Abstract": "As connectivity between and within vehicles increases, so does concern about safety and security. Various automotive serial protocols are used inside vehicles such as Controller Area Network (CAN), Local Interconnect Network (LIN), and FlexRay. CAN Bus is the most used in-vehicle network protocol to support exchange of vehicle parameters between Electronic Control Units (ECUs). This protocol lacks security mechanisms by design and is therefore vulnerable to various attacks. Furthermore, connectivity of vehicles has made the CAN Bus vulnerable not only from within the vehicle but also from outside. With the rise of connected cars, more entry points and interfaces have been introduced on board vehicles, thereby also leading to a wider potential attack surface. Existing security mechanisms focus on the use of encryption, authentication, and vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), which operate under various constraints such as low bandwidth, small frame size (e.g., in the CAN protocol), limited availability of computational resources, and real-time sensitivity. We survey and classify current cryptographic and IDS approaches and compare these approaches based on criteria such as real-time constraints, types of hardware used, changes in CAN Bus behaviour, types of attack mitigation, and software/ hardware used to validate these approaches. We conclude with mitigation strategies limitations and research challenges for the future.",

One way to support stronger end users\u2019 engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users\u2019 DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things. We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.",

        "Abstract": "The security and privacy of smart home systems, particularly from a home user\u2019s perspective, have been a very active research area in recent years. However, via a meta-review of 52 review papers covering related topics (published between 2000 and 2021), this paper shows a lack of a more recent literature review on user perspectives of smart home security and privacy since the 2010s. This identified gap motivated us to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 126 relevant research papers published from 2010 to 2021. Our SLR led to the discovery of a number of important areas where further research is needed; these include holistic methods that consider a more diverse and heterogeneous range of home devices, interactions between multiple home users, complicated data flow between multiple home devices and home users, some less-studied demographic factors, and advanced conceptual frameworks. Based on these findings, we recommended key future research directions, e.g., research for a better understanding of security and privacy aspects in different multi-device and multi-user contexts, and a more comprehensive ontology on the security and privacy of the smart home covering varying types of home devices and behaviors of different types of home users.",

        "Abstract": "The last decade has sparked several valiant efforts in deductive verification of distributed agreement protocols such as consensus and leader election. Oddly, there have been far fewer verification efforts that go beyond the core protocols and target applications that are built on top of agreement protocols. This is unfortunate, as agreement-based distributed services such as data stores, locks, and ledgers are ubiquitous and potentially permit modular, scalable verification approaches that mimic their modular design. We address this need for verification of distributed agreement-based systems through our novel modeling and verification framework, QuickSilver, that is not only modular, but also fully automated. The key enabling feature of QuickSilver is our encoding of abstractions of verified agreement protocols that facilitates modular, decidable, and scalable automated verification. We demonstrate the potential of QuickSilver by modeling and efficiently verifying a series of tricky case studies, adapted from real-world applications, such as a data store, a lock service, a surveillance system, a pathfinding algorithm for mobile robots, and more.",

        "Title": "From Server-Based to Client-Based Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Survey",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, mobile devices have gained increasing development with stronger computation capability and larger storage space. Some of the computation-intensive machine learning tasks can now be run on mobile devices. To exploit the resources available on mobile devices and preserve personal privacy, the concept of client-based machine learning has been proposed. It leverages the users\u2019 local hardware and local data to solve machine learning sub-problems on mobile devices and only uploads computation results rather than the original data for the optimization of the global model. Such an architecture can not only relieve computation and storage burdens on servers but also protect the users\u2019 sensitive information. Another benefit is the bandwidth reduction because various kinds of local data can be involved in the training process without being uploaded. In this article, we provide a literature review on the progressive development of machine learning from server based to client based. We revisit a number of widely used server-based and client-based machine learning methods and applications. We also extensively discuss the challenges and future directions in this area. We believe that this survey will give a clear overview of client-based machine learning and provide guidelines on applying client-based machine learning to practice.",

However, this ease of use of OSNs comes with a cost in terms of users\u2019 privacy and security. The big amount of personal data shared in the users\u2019 profiles or correlated from their activities can be stored, processed, and sold for advertisement or statistical purposes. It attracts also malicious users who can collect and exploit the data and target different types of attacks. In this article, we review the state of the art of OSNs existing either in the literature or deployed for use. We focus on the OSN systems that offer, but not exclusively, microblogging services. We analyze and evaluate each system based on a set of characteristics, and we compare them based on their usability and the level of protection of privacy and security they provide. This study is a first step toward understanding the security and privacy controls and measuring their level in an OSN.",

In this work, we identify the need for low-cost security in current and next-generation IoT networks and address this demand through the implementation, testing, and validation of an intrinsic low-cost and low-overhead hardware-based security primitive within an inherent network component. In particular, an intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is implemented in the peripheral network module of a tri-band commercial off-the-shelf router. Subsequently, we demonstrate the robustness of this PUF to ambient temperature variations and to limited natural aging, and examine in detail its potential for securing the next generation of IoT networks and other applications. Finally, the security of the proposed PUF-based schemes is briefly assessed and discussed.",

However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people\u2019s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.",

This requires developing two quite different models of the same system, without guarantees of semantic consistency between them.

In this context, digital twins deployed on the edge represents a new strategic element to design a new wave of distributed cyber-physical applications. Existing approaches are generally focused on fragmented and domain-specific monolithic solutions and are mainly associated to model-driven, simulative or descriptive visions. The idea of extending the DTs role to support last-mile digitalization and interoperability through a set of general purpose and well-defined properties and capabilities is still underinvestigated. In this paper, we present the novel Edge Digital Twins (EDT) architectural model and its implementation, enabling the lightweight replication of physical devices providing an efficient digital abstraction layer to support the autonomous and standard collaboration of things and services. We model the core capabilities with respect to the recent definition of the state of the art, present the software architecture and a prototype implementation. Extensive experimental analysis shows the obtained performance in multiple IoT application contexts and compares them with that of state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "Abstract": "In this article, we examine the fundamental and taken-for-granted infrastructures that make tech entrepreneurship possible. We report from a longitudinal ethnographic study of tech entrepreneurs situated in occupied Palestine. By investigating this polar case of tech entrepreneurship, we identify critical infrastructures that are otherwise invisible and go unnoticed. We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs\u2019 potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.",

        "Title": "From 'Friends with Benefits' to 'Sextortion:' A Nuanced Investigation of Adolescents' Online Sexual Risk Experiences",
        "Abstract": "Sexual exploration is a natural part of adolescent development; yet, unmediated internet access has enabled teens to engage in a wider variety of potentially riskier sexual interactions than previous generations, from normatively appropriate sexual interactions to sexually abusive situations. Teens have turned to online peer support platforms to disclose and seek support about these experiences. Therefore, we analyzed posts (N=45,955) made by adolescents (ages 13--17) on an online peer support platform to deeply examine their online sexual risk experiences. By applying a mixed methods approach, we 1) accurately (average of AUC = 0.90) identified posts that contained teen disclosures about online sexual risk experiences and classified the posts based on level of consent (i.e., consensual, non-consensual, sexual abuse) and relationship type (i.e., stranger, dating/friend, family) between the teen and the person in which they shared the sexual experience, 2) detected statistically significant differences in the proportions of posts based on these dimensions, and 3) further unpacked the nuance in how these online sexual risk experiences were typically characterized in the posts. Teens were significantly more likely to engage in consensual sexting with friends/dating partners; unwanted solicitations were more likely from strangers and sexual abuse was more likely when a family member was involved. We contribute to the HCI and CSCW literature around youth online sexual risk experiences by moving beyond the false dichotomy of \"safe\" versus \"risky\". Our work provides a deeper understanding of technology-mediated adolescent sexual behaviors from the perspectives of sexual well-being, risk detection, and the prevention of online sexual violence toward youth.",

        "Title": "Who\u2019s Controlling My Device? Multi-User Multi-Device-Aware Access Control System for Shared Smart Home Environment",
        "Abstract": "Multiple users have access to multiple devices in a smart home system \u2013 typically through a dedicated app installed on a mobile device. Traditional access control mechanisms consider one unique, trusted user that controls access to the devices. However, multi-user multi-device smart home settings pose fundamentally different challenges to traditional single-user systems. For instance, in a multi-user environment, users have conflicting, complex, and dynamically-changing demands on multiple devices that cannot be handled by traditional access control techniques. Moreover, smart devices from different platforms/vendors can share the same home environment, making existing access control obsolete for smart home systems. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce Kratos+, a novel multi-user and multi-device-aware access control mechanism that allows smart home users to flexibly specify their access control demands. Kratos+ has four main components: user interaction module, backend server, policy manager, and policy execution module. Users can easily specify their desired access control settings using the interaction module that are translated into access control policies in the back-end server. The policy manager analyzes these policies, initiates automated negotiation between users to resolve conflicting demands, and generates final policies to enforce in smart home systems. We implemented Kratos+ as a platform-independent solution and evaluated its performance on real smart home deployments featuring multi-user scenarios with a rich set of configurations (337 different policies including 231 demand conflicts and 69 restriction policies). These configurations also included five different threats associated with access control mechanisms. Our extensive evaluations show that Kratos+ is very effective in resolving conflicting access control demands with minimal overhead. We also performed an extensive user study with 72 smart home users to better understand the user\u2019s needs before designing the system and a usability study to evaluate the efficacy of Kratos+ in a real-life smart home environment.",

        "Title": "A Method to Analyze Multiple Social Identities in Twitter Bios",
        "Abstract": "Twitter users signal social identity in their profile descriptions, or bios, in a number of important but complex ways that are not well-captured by existing characterizations of how identity is expressed in language. Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.",

        "Title": "Fast Approximate Score Computation on Large-Scale Distributed Data for Learning Multinomial Bayesian Networks",
        "Abstract": "In this article, we focus on the problem of learning a Bayesian network over distributed data stored in a commodity cluster. Specifically, we address the challenge of computing the scoring function over distributed data in an efficient and scalable manner, which is a fundamental task during learning. While exact score computation can be done using the MapReduce-style computation, our goal is to compute approximate scores much faster with probabilistic error bounds and in a scalable manner. We propose a novel approach, which is designed to achieve the following: (a) decentralized score computation using the principle of gossiping; (b) lower resource consumption via a probabilistic approach for maintaining scores using the properties of a Markov chain; and (c) effective distribution of tasks during score computation (on large datasets) by synergistically combining well-known hashing techniques. We conduct theoretical analysis of our approach in terms of convergence speed of the statistics required for score computation, and memory and network bandwidth consumption. We also discuss how our approach is capable of efficiently recomputing scores when new data are available. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our approach and compared with the MapReduce-style computation using datasets of different characteristics on a 16-node cluster. When the MapReduce-style computation provided exact statistics for score computation, it was nearly 10 times slower than our approach. Although it ran faster on randomly sampled datasets than on the entire datasets, it performed worse than our approach in terms of accuracy. Our approach achieved high accuracy (below 6% average relative error) in estimating the statistics for approximate score computation on all the tested datasets. In conclusion, it provides a feasible tradeoff between computation time and accuracy for fast approximate score computation on large-scale distributed data.",

        "Abstract": "We do a game-theoretic analysis of leader election, under the assumption that each agent prefers to have some leader than no leader at all. We show that it is possible to obtain a fair Nash equilibrium, where each agent has an equal probability of being elected leader, in a completely connected network, in a bidirectional ring, and a unidirectional ring, in the synchronous setting. In the asynchronous setting, Nash equilibrium is not quite the right solution concept. Rather, we must consider ex post Nash equilibrium; this means that we have a Nash equilibrium no matter what a scheduling adversary does. We show that ex post Nash equilibrium is attainable in the asynchronous setting in all the networks we consider, using a protocol with bounded running time. However, in the asynchronous setting, we require that n > 2. We show that we can get a fair ex post \u03f5-Nash equilibrium if n=2 in the asynchronous setting under some cryptographic assumptions (specifically, the existence of a one-way functions), using a commitment protocol. We then generalize these results to a setting where we can have deviations by a coalition of size k. In this case, we can get what we call a fair k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network if n> 2k; under the same cryptographic assumptions, we can a get a k-resilient equilibrium in a completely connected network, unidirectional ring, or bidirectional ring if n > k. Finally, we show that under minimal assumptions, not only do our protocols give a Nash equilibrium, they also give a sequential equilibrium, so players even play optimally off the equilibrium path.",

        "Abstract": "Decentralised learning is attracting more and more interest because it embodies the principles of data minimisation and focused data collection, while favouring the transparency of purpose specification (i.e., the objective for which a model is built). Cloud-centric-only processing and deep learning are no longer strict necessities to train high-fidelity models; edge devices can actively participate in the decentralised learning process by exchanging meta-level information in place of raw data, thus paving the way for better privacy guarantees. In addition, these new possibilities can relieve the network backbone from unnecessary data transfer and allow it to meet strict low-latency requirements by leveraging on-device model inference. This survey provides a detailed and up-to-date overview of the most recent contributions available in the state-of-the-art decentralised learning literature. In particular, it originally provides the reader audience with a clear presentation of the peculiarities of federated settings, with a novel taxonomy of decentralised learning approaches, and with a detailed description of the most relevant and specific system-level contributions of the surveyed solutions for privacy, communication efficiency, non-IIDness, device heterogeneity, and poisoning defense.",

        "Abstract": "The hardware description language Verilog has been standardized and widely used in industry. Multithreaded Discrete Event Simulation Language (MDESL) is a Verilog-like language and it contains a rich variety of interesting features such as the event-driven computation and shared-variable concurrency as well as the realtime feature. In this paper, we present the denotational semantics for MDESL based on UTP. First a discrete time semantic model is proposed to describe the observation-oriented semantics for MDESL. The observations record the change of variables of atomic actions over time. Then the healthy formulae are defined to denote all different behaviors of programs and the semantics of programs is expressed in terms of healthy formulae. In addition, we demonstrate some interesting properties about the MDESL programs expressing as algebraic laws and their proofs are supported by our formalized denotational semantics. Our theoretical approach is complemented by a practical one, we use the theorem proof assistant Coq to formalize the UTP-based semantics for MDESL. The correctness of the algebraic laws is also verified via the mechanical approach in Coq. Our work provides a novel way to verify the correctness of UTP-based semantics forMDESL both in a theoretical approach and in a practical approach. It is also a new attempt for the application of Coq in the mechanized semantics.",

        "Abstract": "Interfirm relationships are crucial to our understanding of firms\u2019 collective and interactive behavior. Many information systems-related phenomena, including the diffusion of innovations, standard alliances, technology collaboration, and outsourcing, involve a multitude of relationships between firms. This study proposes a latent space approach to model temporal change in a dual-view interfirm network. We assume that interfirm relationships depend on an underlying latent space; firms that are close to each other in the latent space are more likely to develop a relationship. We construct the latent space by embedding two dynamic networks of firms in an integrated manner, resulting in a more comprehensive view of an interfirm relationship. We validate our approach by introducing three business measures derived from the latent space model to study alliance formation and stock comovement. We illustrate how the trajectories of firms provide insights into alliance activities. We also show that our proposed measures have strong predictive power on stock comovement. We believe the proposed approach enriches the methodology toolbox of IS researchers in studying interfirm relationships.",

        "Abstract": "Side-channel attacks, which are capable of breaking secrecy via side-channel information, pose a growing threat to the implementation of cryptographic algorithms. Masking is an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks by removing the statistical dependence between secrecy and power consumption via randomization. However, designing efficient and effective masked implementations turns out to be an error-prone task. Current techniques for verifying whether masked programs are secure are limited in their applicability and accuracy, especially when they are applied. To bridge this gap, in this article, we first propose a sound type system, equipped with an efficient type inference algorithm, for verifying masked arithmetic programs against higher-order attacks. We then give novel model-counting-based and pattern-matching-based methods that are able to precisely determine whether the potential leaky observable sets detected by the type system are genuine or simply spurious. We evaluate our approach on various implementations of arithmetic cryptographic programs. The experiments confirm that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of applicability, accuracy, and efficiency.",

        "Title": "Assessing the alignment between the information needs of developers and the documentation of programming languages: A case study on Rust",
        "Abstract": "Programming language documentation refers to the set of technical documents that provide application developers with a description of the high-level concepts of a language (e.g., manuals, tutorials, and API references). Such documentation is essential to support application developers in effectively using a programming language. One of the challenges faced by documenters (i.e., personnel that design and produce documentation for a programming language) is to ensure that documentation has relevant information that aligns with the concrete needs of developers, defined as the missing knowledge that developers acquire via voluntary search. In this paper, we present an automated approach to support documenters in evaluating the differences and similarities between the concrete information need of developers and the current state of documentation (a problem that we refer to as the topical alignment of a programming language documentation). Our approach leverages semi-supervised topic modelling that uses domain knowledge to guide the derivation of topics. We initially train a baseline topic model from a set of Rust-related Q&A posts. We then use this baseline model to determine the distribution of topic probabilities of each document of the official Rust documentation. Afterwards, we assess the similarities and differences between the topics of the Q&A posts and the official documentation. Our results show a relatively high level of topical alignment in Rust documentation. Still, information about specific topics is scarce in both the Q&A websites and the documentation, particularly related topics with programming niches such as network, game, and database development. For other topics (e.g., related topics with language features such as structs, patterns and matchings, and foreign function interface), information is only available on Q&A websites while lacking in the official documentation. Finally, we discuss implications for programming language documenters, particularly how to leverage our approach to prioritize topics that should be added to the documentation.",

        "Title": "Ares: Adaptive, Reconfigurable, Erasure coded, Atomic Storage",
        "Abstract": "Emulating a shared atomic, read/write storage system is a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Replicating atomic objects among a set of data hosts was the norm for traditional implementations (e.g., [11]) in order to guarantee the availability and accessibility of the data despite host failures. As replication is highly storage demanding, recent approaches suggested the use of erasure-codes to offer the same fault-tolerance while optimizing storage usage at the hosts. Initial works focused on a fixed set of data hosts. To guarantee longevity and scalability, a storage service should be able to dynamically mask hosts failures by allowing new hosts to join, and failed host to be removed without service interruptions. This work presents the first erasure-code -based atomic algorithm, called Ares, which allows the set of hosts to be modified in the course of an execution. Ares is composed of three main components: (i) a reconfiguration protocol, (ii) a read/write protocol, and (iii) a set of data access primitives (DAPs). The design of Ares is modular and is such to accommodate the usage of various erasure-code parameters on a per-configuration basis. We provide bounds on the latency of read/write operations and analyze the storage and communication costs of the Ares algorithm.",

        "Abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystems tend to grow both in scale and complexity, as they consist of a variety of heterogeneous devices that span over multiple architectural IoT layers (e.g., cloud, edge, sensors). Further, IoT systems increasingly demand the resilient operability of services, as they become part of critical infrastructures. This leads to a broad variety of research works that aim to increase the resilience of these systems. In this article, we create a systematization of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making IoT systems resilient. In particular, we first discuss the taxonomy and classification of resilience and resilience mechanisms and subsequently survey state-of-the-art resilience mechanisms that have been proposed by research work and are applicable to IoT. As part of the survey, we also discuss questions that focus on the practical aspects of resilience, e.g., which constraints resilience mechanisms impose on developers when designing resilient systems by incorporating a specific mechanism into IoT systems.",

        "Title": "Robust Secret Image Sharing Resistant to Noise in Shares",
        "Abstract": "A secret image is split into \n shares in the generation phase of secret image sharing (SIS) for a \nthreshold. In the recovery phase, the secret image is recovered when any \n or more shares are collected, and each collected share is generally assumed to be lossless in conventional SIS during storage and transmission. However, noise will arise during real-world storage and transmission; thus, shares will experience data loss, which will also lead to data loss in the secret image being recovered. Secret image recovery in the case of lossy shares is an important issue that must be addressed in practice, which is the overall subject of this article. An SIS scheme that can recover the secret image from lossy shares is proposed in this article. First, robust SIS and its definition are introduced. Next, a robust SIS scheme for a \nthreshold without pixel expansion is proposed based on the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) and error-correcting codes (ECC). By screening the random numbers, the share generation phase of the proposed robust SIS is designed to implement the error correction capability without increasing the share size. Particularly in the case of collecting noisy shares, our recovery method is to some degree robust to some noise types, such as least significant bit (LSB) noise, JPEG compression, and salt-and-pepper noise. A theoretical proof is presented, and experimental results are examined to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "Title": "Federated Learning Over Wireless Networks: Convergence Analysis and Resource Allocation",
        "Abstract": "There is an increasing interest in a fast-growing machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL), in which the model training is distributed over mobile user equipment (UEs), exploiting UEs' local computation and training data. Despite its advantages such as preserving data privacy, FL still has challenges of heterogeneity across UEs' data and physical resources. To address these challenges, we first propose FEDL, a FL algorithm which can handle heterogeneous UE data without further assumptions except strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We provide a convergence rate characterizing the trade-off between local computation rounds of each UE to update its local model and global communication rounds to update the FL global model. We then employ FEDL in wireless networks as a resource allocation optimization problem that captures the trade-off between FEDL convergence wall clock time and energy consumption of UEs with heterogeneous computing and power resources. Even though the wireless resource allocation problem of FEDL is non-convex, we exploit this problem's structure to decompose it into three sub-problems and analyze their closed-form solutions as well as insights into problem design. Finally, we empirically evaluate the convergence of FEDL with PyTorch experiments, and provide extensive numerical results for the wireless resource allocation sub-problems. Experimental results show that FEDL outperforms the vanilla FedAvg algorithm in terms of convergence rate and test accuracy in various settings.",

More recently, the Web of Things (WoT), which is an extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) with metadata expressed in Web standards, and its community provide further motivation for pushing the autonomous agents research agenda forward. Although representing and reasoning about norms, policies, and preferences is crucial to ensuring that autonomous agents act in a manner that satisfies stakeholder requirements, normative concepts, policies, and preferences have yet to be considered as first-class abstractions in Web-based multiagent systems. Towards this end, this article motivates the need for alignment and joint research across the Multiagent Systems, Semantic Web, and WoT communities, introduces a conceptual framework for governance of autonomous agents on the Web, and identifies several research challenges and opportunities.",

It has recently been shown that a given state predicate can be monitored consistently by a set of crash-prone asynchronous distributed monitors observing the system, only if each monitor can emit verdicts taken from a large enough finite set. We revisit this impossibility result in the concrete context of linear-time logic (ltl) semantics for runtime verification, that is, when the correctness of the system is specified by an ltl formula on its execution traces. First, we show that monitors synthesized based on the 4-valued semantics of ltl (rv-ltl) may result in inconsistent distributed monitoring, even for some simple ltl formulas. More generally, given any ltl formula \u03c6, we relate the number of different verdicts required by the monitors for consistently monitoring \u03c6, with a specific structural characteristic of \u03c6 called its alternation number. Specifically, we show that, for every k \u2265 0, there is an ltl formula \u03c6 with alternation number k that cannot be verified at runtime by distributed monitors emitting verdicts from a set of cardinality smaller than k + 1. On the positive side, we define a family of logics, called distributed ltl (abbreviated as dltl), parameterized by k \u2265 0, which refines rv-ltl by incorporating 2k + 4 truth values. Our main contribution is to show that, for every k \u2265 0, every ltl formula \u03c6 with alternation number k can be consistently monitored by distributed monitors, each running an automaton based on a (2 \u2308 k/2 \u2309 +4)-valued logic taken from the dltl family.",

        "Title": "2D Vector Map Fragile Watermarking with Region Location",
        "Abstract": "Locating the original region of tampered features is a challenging task for existing 2D vector map fragile watermarking methods. This article presents a 2D vector map fragile watermarking framework that locates not only the current but also the original region of tampered feature groups. In particular, we propose dividing the features of the host vector map into groups, and embedding a watermark consisting of location-bits and check-bits into each group at the sender side. At the receiver side, by comparing the extracted and calculated check-bits, one can identify tampered groups and locate their current regions. Then the location-bits extracted from the mapping groups are used to indicate the original regions of the tampered groups. To demonstrate and analyze the applicability of this framework, we instantiate it by proposing a simulated annealing (SA)-based group division method, a group mapping method, a minimum encasing rectangle (MER) based location-bits generation method and a check-bits generation method, and use an existing reversible data hiding method for watermark embedding. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can locate all the regions influenced by tampering, and the SA-based group division method can get a better region location ability.",

The original scheme focused on maximizing single partition (SP) performance, producing results in millions of transactions per second on modest clusters, but at the expense of dismal MP performance. In this paper, we show that original RCST algorithms be made to dramatically improve MP performance with very limited impact on SP performance. That makes RCST superior to popular optimistic and pessimistic schemes without optimizations for batch execution, including OCC and 2PL, on a wide range of multi-node workloads with up to 60% throughput improvement.",

For such applications, edge computing addresses the new computational needs, as well as privacy, availability, and real-time constraints, by providing local high-performance computing capabilities to deal with the limitations and constraints of cloud and embedded systems. Edge computing is today driven by strong market forces stemming from IT/cloud, telecom, and networking\u2014with corresponding multiple interpretations of \u201cedge computing\u201d (e.g., device edge, network edge, distributed cloud).

        "Abstract": "The paper proposes a novel framework based on the contract theory and Lyapunov optimization for content sharing in a wireless content delivery network (CDN) with edge caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. The network is partitioned into a set of clusters. In a cluster, users can share contents via D2D links in coordination with the cluster head. Upon receiving the content request from any user in its cluster, the cluster head either delivers the content itself or forwards the request to another node, i.e., a base station (BS) or another user in the cluster. The content access at the BS and in each cluster is modeled as a queuing system, where arrivals represent the content requests directed to respective nodes. The objective is to assign content delivery nodes to stabilize all queues while minimizing the time-averaged network cost given incomplete information about content sharing costs of the users and unknown distribution of the network state defined by users' locations and their cached/requested content. The proposed framework allows the users to truthfully reveal their content sharing expenditures, minimize the time-averaged network cost and stabilize the queuing system representing the CDN. Based on this framework, a distributed content access and delivery algorithm where the node assignments are made by every cluster head independently is developed. It is shown that the algorithm converges to the optimal policy with the trade-off in total queue backlog and achieves a superior performance compared with some other D2D content sharing policies.",

        "Title": "Cloud Pricing Models: Taxonomy, Survey, and Interdisciplinary Challenges",
        "Abstract": "This article provides a systematic review of cloud pricing in an interdisciplinary approach. It examines many historical cases of pricing in practice and tracks down multiple roots of pricing in research. The aim is to help both cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud customers to capture the essence of cloud pricing when they need to make a critical decision either to achieve competitive advantages or to manage cloud resource effectively. Currently, the number of available pricing schemes in the cloud market is overwhelming. It is an intricate issue to understand these schemes and associated pricing models clearly due to involving several domains of knowledge, such as cloud technologies, microeconomics, operations research, and value theory. Some earlier studies have introduced this topic unsystematically. Their approaches inevitably lead to much confusion for many cloud decision-makers. To address their weaknesses, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud pricing, which is driven by a framework of three fundamental pricing strategies that are built on nine cloud pricing categories. These categories can be further mapped onto a total of 60 pricing models. Many of the pricing models have been already adopted by CSPs. Others have been widespread across in other industries. We give descriptions of these model categories and highlight both advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, this article offers an extensive survey of many cloud pricing models that were proposed by many researchers during the past decade. Based on the survey, we identify four trends of cloud pricing and the general direction, which is moving from intrinsic value per physical box to extrinsic value per serverless sandbox. We conclude that hyper-converged cloud resources pool supported by cloud orchestration, virtual machine, Open Application Programming Interface, and serverless sandbox will drive the future of cloud pricing.",

        "Title": "Online Aggregation of the Forwarding Information Base: Accounting for Locality and Churn",
        "Abstract": "This paper studies the problem of compressing the forwarding information base FIB, but taking a wider perspective. Indeed, FIB compression goes beyond sheer compression, as the gain in memory use obtained from the compression has consequences on the updates that will have to be applied to the compressed FIB. We are interested in the situation where forwarding rules can change over time, e.g., due to border gateway protocol BGP route updates. Accordingly, we frame FIB compression as an online problem and design competitive online algorithms to solve it. In contrast to prior work which mostly focused on static optimizations, we study an online variant of the problem where routes can change over time and where the number of updates to the FIB is taken into account explicitly. The reason to consider this version of the problem is that leveraging temporal locality while accounting for the number of FIB updates helps to keep routers CPU load low and reduces the number of FIB updates to be transferred, e.g., from the network-attached software-defined network controller to a remote switch. This paper introduces a formal model which is an interesting generalization of several classic online aggregation problems. Our main contribution is an Ow-competitive algorithm, where ${w}$ is the length of an IP address. We also derive a lower bound which shows that our result is asymptotically optimal within a natural class of algorithms, based on so-called sticks.",

        "Title": "ArtChain: Blockchain-Enabled Platform for Art Marketplace",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global industry and create a trusted relationship in a multi-party business network. There are a number of practical use cases where blockchain has been applied. One specific area is the Art industry, where it is a natural fit in the way that art forensics and transactions are conducted, tracked and recorded. This motivates us to develop the ArtChain platform to assist the Art Industry. In this paper, we present ArtChain, which is an integrated trading system based on blockchain. It includes the front end, the back end, the services, the smart contract, the chain connection and the deployment scripts from the bottom to the top. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployed blockchain-enabled art trading platform in Australia. It provides a transparent yet privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof transaction history for registration, provenance, and traceability of art assets. Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical. For the interest of other researchers, our system implementation related resources are open-sourced on Github.",

        "Abstract": "Current blockchain relay schemes require the immediate validation of each relayed block header by the destination blockchain. This leads to high operating cost when deploying these relays between Ethereum-based blockchains where validating block headers on-chain is computationally expensive.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel relay scheme that employs a validation-on-demand pattern combined with economic incentives to reduce the cost of operating a relay between Ethereum-based blockchains by up to 92%. With this relay scheme, decentralized interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic becomes feasible.",

        "Abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a popular protocol used in Blockchain systems to resolve double-spending problems. However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.",

The virtual power plant is an important branch of the energy internet, and it plays an important role in the aggregation of distributed power generation resources and the establishment of virtual power resource transactions. However, in the existing virtual power plant model, the following problems are becoming increasingly prominent, such as safeguard, credit rating system, privacy protection, benefit distribution. Firstly, the operation and transaction mechanism of the virtual power plant was introduced. Then, the blockchain technology is introduced into the virtual power plant transaction to make it more conducive to the information transparent, stable dispatch system, data security, and storage security. Finally, the operation and transaction system based on blockchain technology for the virtual power plant was design.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, leading research communities have been investigating the use of blockchains for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, where multiple participants, or agents, collaborate to make consensus decisions. To achieve this, the data in the blockchain storage have to be transformed into blockchain knowledge. We refer to these types of blockchains as knowledge-based blockchains. Knowledge-based blockchains are potentially useful in building efficient risk assessment applications. An earlier work introduced probabilistic blockchain which facilitates knowledge-based blockchains. This paper proposes an extension for the probabilistic blockchain concept. The design of a reputation management framework, suitable for such blockchains, is proposed. The framework has been developed to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications. In particular, we apply it to the detection of malicious nodes and reduce their effect on the probabilistic blockchains' consensus process. We evaluate the framework by comparing it to a baseline using several adversarial strategies. Further, we analyze the collaborative decisions with and without the malicious node detection. Both results show a sustainable performance, where the proposed work outperforms others and achieves excellent results.",

        "Abstract": "Today's blockchain landscape is severely fragmented as more and more heterogeneous blockchain platforms have been developed in recent years. These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

However, there may be unauthorized access while sharing data, which makes many entities unwilling to share their data to prevent data leakage. Based on blockchain and ABAC (Attribute-based Access Control) technology, this paper proposes an access control scheme, so that users can achieve fine-grained access control of their data when sharing them. The solution uses smart contract to achieve automated and reliable policy evaluation. IPFS (Interplanetary File System) is used for off-chain distributed storage to share the storage pressure of blockchain and guarantee the reliable storage of data. At the same time, all processes in the system are stored in the blockchain, ensuring the accountability of the system. Finally, the experiment proves the feasibility of the proposed scheme.",

The system consists of a modified version of the Bitcoin Core client which is intended to run on Raspberry PI machines, modified so that the latency in the block production and propagation can be manually introduced, which simulates network communication issues in the real Bitcoin network. Built-in LCD displays on each machine visualize current state of their local blockchains which allows easy visual observation of the consensus in the network. As machines are running fully capable Bitcoin Core clients, as well as mining clients for production of new blocks in the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocol, it is possible to investigate different configuration scenarios and when these lead to the break of the consensus.",

        "Abstract": "Traceability and integrity are major challenges for the increasingly complex supply chains of today's world. Although blockchain technology has the potential to address these challenges through providing a tamper-proof audit trail of supply chain events and data associated with a product life-cycle, it does not solve the trust problem associated with the data itself. Reputation systems are an effective approach to solve this trust problem. However, current reputation systems are not suited to the blockchain based supply chain applications as they are based on limited observations, they lack granularity and automation, and their overhead has not been explored. In this work, we propose TrustChain, as a three-layered trust management framework which uses a consortium blockchain to track interactions among supply chain participants and to dynamically assign trust and reputation scores based on these interactions. The novelty of Trustchain stems from: (a) the reputation model that evaluates the quality of commodities, and the trustworthiness of entities based on multiple observations of supply chain events, (b) its support for reputation scores that separate between a supply chain participant and products, enabling the assignment of product-specific reputations for the same participant, (c) the use of smart contracts for transparent, efficient, secure, and automated calculation of reputation scores, and (d) its minimal overhead in terms of latency and throughput when compared to a simple blockchain based supply chain model.",

        "Abstract": "Timed-release of information refers to releasing protected sensitive data at a future point of time while securely protecting the information until the release time. Blockchain-based self-emerging data infrastructures consist of a group of blockchain accounts that jointly take charge of protecting and transferring the data at the release time. Existing solutions have focused on fully rational adversarial environments in which all peer accounts are rational. However, such protection disregards scenarios in which malicious peer accounts also exist. In our work, we focus on protecting blockchain-based timed-release service in mixed adversarial environments in which both rational peer accounts and malicious peer accounts exist. We introduce our blockchain-based timed-release framework designed for mixed adversarial environments and illustrate two concrete attacks, namely drop attack and release-ahead attack, and discuss our reputation-based solution.",

        "Abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

Despite having valuable properties like decentralisation, and immutability of transactions, it incurs a high performance overhead as compared with traditional databases thus discouraging its further adoption. Even the usage of different transaction processors within the same Blockchain platform, namely Hyperledger Sawtooth, may result in different performance, for the same use case and the same transaction type. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the performance of two different transaction processors deployed in the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform. We evaluated experimentally the methodology and present the results of the experimental evaluation which may be useful to blockchain practitioners for future solution designs.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.",

The solution consists of data sharing model and data sharing protocol. Firstly, using the distributed storage, decentralized management and non-tampering characteristics of the blockchain, we designed a data security sharing model. The model sets access control strategies on the blockchain platform, and uses the blockchain platform and distributed databases to store encrypted data together to prevent sensitive data from being tampered with and leaked. The data sharing protocol uses identity-based proxy re-encryption technology and distributed key generation technology. The protocol selects proxy nodes by the proof-of-stake algorithm, and realizes data sharing among users by re-encrypting sensitive data. The analysis of the solution discusses the correctness and security of the proposed scheme in terms of key generation.",

        "Title": "Evaluating the Impact of Network Latency on the Safety of Blockchain Transactions",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain came to prominence as the distributed ledger underneath Bitcoin, which protects the transaction histories in a fully-connected, peer-to-peer network. For safety against double-spending, a bitcoin transaction is only considered to be unrevokable after it is within a chain of at least six mined blocks on the blockchain-termed \"six confirmations\" for short. Besides the use for securing financial activity, blockchain technology is now also merged with various emerging applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET). However, such emerging applications may have comparatively low Internet connectivity due to incorporating mobile devices, that may range away from network infrastructure. This paper investigates the impact of network latency on blockchain forking behavior and possible violations of the aforementioned six confirmations convention for transaction approval. To speed up our simulations, we simplify the lockchain's data structure, and avoid the extensive computation required in proof-of-work (PoW). Through simulation, we show that the six confirmations convention is sensitive to the peer-to-peer network latency, and also show how quickly it is violated with an easier difficulty of PoW mining. Unsurprisingly, the speed at which all nodes on the blockchain converge is shown to be severely affected by the latency of the underlying peer-to-peer network. It is also shown the extent to which nodes with more frequent Internet connectivity can gain an unfair advantage in terms of proof-ofwork mining rewards. We thus recommend that networks with heterogeneous latency profiles across nodes monitor fairness, and potentially preclude some nodes from being miners.",

        "Abstract": "Collaborative development in open-source software (OSS) has long been limited by the lack of participation, i.e., A project is often maintained by an insufficient number of developers, especially for small- and medium-size projects. To establish a sustainable ecosystem for global developers and projects, we propose a decentralised and trustless open-source protocol Committable for all OSS software. The key insight behind Committable is an accountable and trusted tokenisation technology on blockchain that creates the CMT software assets for a variety of artefacts (e.g., document, code, testcase, makefile etc..) across the whole development lifecycle. A CMT token defines an abstraction of commits to OSS and systematically models the contribution from developers, therefore is far more comprehensive than a commit hash that are commonly used to identify software versions. In further, Committable introduces the Problem-Solution-Risk (PSR) framework to evaluate and reward a given set of CMT in an unbiased manner based on their contributions to a project. Owners of CMT are allowed to trade their tokens in the marketplace on blockchain established by Committable. The trading of CMT leads to transfer of token rights (e.g., sell, earn PSR rewards etc.), and more importantly, royalty to the developer for his or her original contribution. This demonstration proposal will introduce Committable on the test net of Ethereum and describe a preliminary case study with the OpenZeppelin project.",

Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology or a software component, requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of their technical principles and characteristics. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of blockchains usage and understanding their performance. Towards that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework which aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols, focusing on different aspects such as security and scalability. A set of modules is introduced for testing and evaluating the behaviour of blockchain protocols under different test scenarios.",

The traditional blockchain ensures the reliability of all data by making it public, thus reaching consensus and maintaining the consistency of the global state. This means that everyone's transaction data is phanic to the outside world, resulting in a massive breach of users' personal privacy. Since this reason, we propose a new kind of blockchain privacy protection scheme, which applies the trusted execution environment in the blockchain, designs an encrypted communication and authentication scheme, and realizes the function of providing privacy protection for the blockchain. And most of the computations are moved out of the chain, which greatly reduces the delay and burden of on-chain computations.

        "Title": "A Hybrid Blockchain Architecture for Privacy-Enabled and Accountable Auctions",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based aucti...",

However, Traditional centralized storage cannot meet performance and security requirements and fully distributed storage consumes a large amount of computing, storage and network resources, which is inefficient and difficult to implement. In this paper, we propose a clustering strategy on node community clustering by constructing a trust model based on the decentralization of blockchain technology. We introduce a multi-chain storage structure. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces data synchronization time and storage space, improves system performance by enabling efficient parallel processing.",

The most appealing aspect of cryptocurrencies that garnered significant attention is its potential to enable (pseudo) anonymous transactions on the blockchain ledger. Unsurprisingly, this has led to rapid adoption of cryptocurrencies for unlawful activities by malicious actors in several ways. Hence, to detect these unlawful activities, it is essential to analyze the blockchain ledgers to derive insights by investigating anonymous transactions and activities, which is where blockchain forensics comes in. In this paper, we present a taxonomy mapping the identified high-level forensics features with the supporting forensics tools that we surveyed. We provide a comparison of the surveyed tools using three practical parameters (number of cryptocurrencies supported, number of features provided and ease of accessing services) and give an overview of their theoretical effectiveness in general with some open challenges identified.",

To safe-guard security and privacy of EHR, access control is an essential mechanism for managing EHR data. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture to facilitate access control of EHR data by using both blockchain and edge node. Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.",

        "Abstract": "A neural key exchange is a secret key exchange technique based on neural synchronization of the neural network. Since the neural key exchange is based on synchronizing weights within the neural network structure, the security of the algorithm does not depend on the attacker's computational capabilities. However, due to the neural key exchange's repetitive mutual-learning processes, using explicit user authentication methods -such as a public key certificate- is inefficient due to high communication overhead. Implicit authentication based on information that only authorized users know can significantly reduce overhead in communications. However, there was a lack of realistic methods to distribute secret information for authentication among authorized users. In this paper, we propose the concept idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, we present a method to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain.",

However, user privacy protection's performance and data capacity have not been well studied in existing access control models of blockchain systems because of traceability and openness of the P2P network. This paper focuses on investigating performance and data capacity from a blockchain infrastructure perspective, which adds secondary encryption to shield confidential information in a non-invasive way. First, we propose an efficient asymmetric encryption scheme by combining homomorphic encryption and state-of-the-art multi-signature key aggregation to preserve privacy. Second, we use smart contracts and CA infrastructure to achieve attribute-based access control. Then, we use the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof scheme to achieve secondary confidentiality explicitly. Finally, experiments show our scheme succeeds better performance in data capacity and system than other schemes. This scheme improves availability and robust scalability, solves the problem of multi-signature key distribution and the unlinkability of transactions. Our scheme has established a sound security cross-chain system and privacy confidentiality mechanism and that has more excellent performance and higher system computing ability than other schemes.",

        "Abstract": "Cryptocurrencies are poised to revolutionize the modern economy by democratizing commerce. These currencies operate on top of blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Existing permissionless blockchain-based protocols offer unparalleled benefits like decentralization, anonymity, and transparency. However, these protocols suffer in performance which hinders their widespread adoption. In particular, high time-to-finality and low transaction rates keep them from replacing centralized payment systems such as the Visa network. Permissioned blockchain protocols offer attractive performance guarantees, but they are not considered suitable for deploying decentralized cryptocurrencies due to their centralized nature. Researchers have developed several multi-layered blockchain protocols that combine both permissioned and permissionless blockchain protocols to achieve high performance along with decentralization. The key idea with existing layered blockchain protocols in literature is to divide blockchain operations into two layers and use different types of consensus to manage each layer. However, many such works come with the assumptions of honest majority which may not accurately reflect the real world where the participants may be self-interested or rational. These assumptions may render the protocols susceptible to security threats in the real world, as highlighted by the literature focused on exploring game-theoretic attacks on these protocols. We generalize the \u201clayered\u201d approach taken by existing protocols in the literature and present a framework to analyze the system in the BAR Model and provide a generalized game-theoretic analysis of such protocols. Using our analysis, we identify the critical system parameters required for a distributed ledger\u2019s secure operation in a more realistic setting.",

        "Title": "Towards Enabling Deletion in Append-Only Blockchains to Support Data Growth Management and GDPR Compliance",
        "Abstract": "Conventional blockchain implementations with append-only semantics do not support deleting or overwriting data in confirmed blocks. However, many industry-relevant use cases require the ability to delete data, especially when personally identifiable information is stored or when data growth has to be constrained. Existing attempts to reconcile these contradictions compromise on core qualities of the blockchain paradigm, as they include backdoor-like approaches such as central authorities with elevated rights or usage of specialized chameleon hash algorithms in chaining of the blocks. The contribution of this paper is a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and consensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A context chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and persons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting context isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context without side effects to other contexts. We show how this architecture supports truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, how the GDPR regulations can be fulfilled by this architecture and how it differs from sidechains and state channels.",

As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.",

        "Abstract": "The main advantage of the Bitcoin-style blockchain systems is immutability of data and decentralized authority. Despite its success, Bitcoin suffers from scalability issues. The potential of the blockchain technology cannot be fully realized unless it is made more scalable. We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain. FastChain improves the throughput by 20%~40% in the normal operations.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has been treated as one of the most promising technologies to promote crowdsourcing by providing new nice features, such as decentralization and accountability. Unfortunately, some inherent limitations of blockchain have been rarely addressed by the most existing works when applying blockchain into crowdsourcing, which becomes the performance bottleneck of crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform to achieve decentralization and privacy preservation. Our platform integrates with a hybrid blockchain structure, dual-ledgers, and dual consensus algorithms to ensure secure communication between the requesters and the workers. Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively. Finally, we conduct experiments to confirm the efficiency of the adopted consensus algorithm on our platform by comparing it with the state-of-the-art.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, electronic medical records(EMR) have became a new type of digital medical service instead of handwritten paper medical records. However, due to different medical institutions belong to different trustworthy domains, there exites barriers to health data exchang, interoperability, and so on. Considering that it was difficult to share medical record data among different medical institutions, we propose an blockchain based EMR data sharing scheme with searchable and verifiable encryption, i.e. SV-DEMR. In SV-DEMR, we propose a hybrid chain which includes consortium chain and private chain. To acheive the secure storage and sharing of EMR, we use the medical institution server to store the EMR ciphertext, the private chain to store the ciphertext hash value, and the consortium chain to share the ciphertext and key parameters. Moreover, we also propose a CP-ABE algorithm that ciphertext searchable and identity verifiable to realize access control and guarantee authenticity of data and efficient index of ciphertext on the blockchain, named SV-CPABE. Finally, the security of our SV-DEMR is proved theoretically. The extensive experiments are made to demonstrate the better performance in SV-DEMR.",

With the access of a large number of heterogeneous edge devices and the in-depth development of edge computing technology in various fields, it has brought huge challenges to the security management and data privacy protection in the edge computing architecture. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight edge computing data privacy-preserving scheme based on blockchain and homomorphic encryption. Above all, set edge computing servers as distributed nodes of the blockchain network and utilize the decentralization of blockchain and the non-tamperable characteristics of information to ensure the distributed storage of data and information recording. Then, designing a blockchain data encryption transmission scheme based on homomorphic encryption which could guarantee data transmission between edge nodes in the form of homomorphic ciphertext. Meanwhile, supporting the verification of the legality and correctness of the transaction in the form of ciphertext. Simulation experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can carry out effective data encryption transmission and has certain application potential.",

        "Abstract": "We present a blockchain based system that allows data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to collaboratively train machine learning models in a trustless AI marketplace. Data is a highly valued digital asset and central to deriving business insights. Our system enables data owners to retain ownership and privacy of their data, while still allowing AI developers to leverage the data for training. Similarly, AI developers can utilize compute resources from cloud vendors without loosing ownership or privacy of their trained models. Our system protocols are set up to incentivize all three entities - data owners, cloud vendors, and AI developers to truthfully record their actions on the distributed ledger, so that the blockchain system provides verifiable evidence of wrongdoing and dispute resolution. Our system is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric and can provide a viable alternative to centralized AI systems that do not guarantee data or model privacy. We present experimental performance results that demonstrate the latency and throughput of its transactions under different network configurations where peers on the blockchain may be spread across different datacenters and geographies. Our results indicate that the proposed solution scales well to large number of data and model owners and can train up to 70 models per second on a 12-peer non optimized blockchain network and roughly 30 models per second in a 24 peer network.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain, originated from Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention from the academic community because of its decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system.",

However, recognition and discoverability of peer reviews in a systematic way is challenging because of the multitude of stakeholders and discrepancies between systems that report peer review statistics. We propose a blockchain-enabled application called PeerView that empowers researchers, publishers, and other stakeholders to integrate and access peer review information in a decentralized data structure, such as a blockchain. Furthermore, due to the cryptographic, immutable, decentralized, and autonomous nature of a blockchain, we can support data security, privacy, and provenance. Ultimately, this ensures that no central or individual entity will have complete ownership over the valuable data contained within, while still ensuring that peer review metrics can be properly attributed. We provide the initial prototype application along with an integration with an open peer review journal, F1000Research.",

        "Abstract": "Thanks to rapid technological advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), a smart public safety (SPS) system has become feasible by integrating heterogeneous computing devices to collaboratively provide public protection services. While service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been adopted by IoT and cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is difficult for a monolithic architecture to provide scalable and extensible services for a distributed IoT based SPS system. Furthermore, traditional security solutions rely on a centralized authority, which can be a performance bottleneck or single point failure. Inspired by microservices architecture and blockchain technology, this paper proposes a BLockchain-ENabled Decentralized Microservices Architecture for Smart public safety (BlendMAS). Within a permissioned blockchain network, a microservices based security mechanism is introduced to secure data access control in an SPS system. The functionality of security services is decoupled into separate containerized microservices that are built using a smart contract and deployed on edge and fog computing nodes. An extensive experimental study verified that the proposed BlendMAS is able to offer a decentralized, scalable and secured data sharing and access control to distributed IoT based SPS system.",

        "Abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

        "Abstract": "Fiscal agencies have been facing several challenges regarding the legitimate exercise of professions. In particular, the context of medicine exercise poses as a crucial one, since the professionals involved in this field are responsible for dealing with the health of third parties. However, we may notice a number of incidents and frauds related to the professionals records of physicians, such as issuing forged diplomas or availability of information not validated. In order to avoid these frauds, one can highlight the relevance of investigating innovative solutions aiming to maintain in a safe and transparent way the professional history of each doctor. In this context, our objective and major contribution is to present MIRIAM, a blockchain-based web application based on the Hyperledger platform, that allows, in a decentralized and reliable fashion, the storage of relevant information necessary for managing registrations of medical professionals. In addition, we explored the Brazilian regulatory framework to clarify the solution's feasibility in a real-world workflow scenario.",

In order to cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a security authentication system named iot-chain in the Internet of Things, which provides attribute-based security authentication based on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain framework. The system contains three kinds of chain codes, namely access code, device code, and policy code. The access code is the main program that implements the user safety authentication method. The device code provides a query method for the URL of the resource data generated by the storage device, and the policy code provides the access control strategy for the administrator user. Combining access control and blockchain technology, iot-chain provides dynamic security authentication management in the Internet of Things. Experimental results show that iot-chain can maintain high throughput and effectively reach consensus in a distributed system.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

        "Abstract": "Publish/subscribe is a communication paradigm used in distributed applications to easily exchange messages. This paradigm usually has a centralized architecture where a broker is responsible for transferring all the messages, hence can be a source of trust issues. In a threat model where the broker can be malicious, two honest entities cannot be sure of the origin of a message. There exist propositions for distributed publish/subscribe protocols replacing the broker by a blockchain. Those propositions all have in common an extensive usage of the blockchain, which makes them expensive over time, due to blockchain fees, and not scalable. In this paper, we introduce SUPRA, a distributed publish/subscribe protocol. This protocol has the same security guarantees than other solutions relying on blockchains, but where the vast majority of messages are off-chain. The message exchanges are done mostly directly between publishers and subscribers and the blockchain is only used in case of network issues, if a message is lost, or an entity is suspected to be malicious.",

While most people focus only on cryptocurrencies when they think about Blockchain, in fact many administrative activities and day-to-day services are managed offline and/or privately are now being securely transferred to the Internet as online services. Electronic Voting is one of the trending and important aspect of online services. Traditional voting systems in our country include the use of ballots at polling stations or EVM's (Electronic Voting Machine). The ballot system is prone to tampering, whereas EVM's being a centralised system, are prone to hacking. We aim to offer a more secure, transparent, safer, cheaper and easier to use alternative to the above methods of voting, by making use of the revolutionary Blockchain technology. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of code that are incorporated into the Blockchain and implemented on schedule at each stage of the Blockchain update. Ethereum and its network is one of the most convenient due to its stability, wide usability and smart contract logic. In this work, we will be implementing and testing a prototype of an E-Voting application using Ethereum Wallet and Solidity language as a smart contract for the Ethereum network.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is seen as a promising technology to provide reliable and secure services due to its decentralized characteristic. However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

        "Abstract": "Although Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention, the inaccurate pricing of Bitcoin options has resulted in an inefficient crypto derivative market. In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",

        "Abstract": "At an era of new emerging technologies, and spotting lights to blockchain technology specifically; many promises take place. Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

It incorporates well-known technologies, including BitTorrent and Git, to create a swarm of computing systems that share information. Since its introduction in 2016, IPFS has seen great improvements and adoption from both individuals and enterprise organizations. Its distributed network allows users to share files and information across the globe. IPFS works well with large files that may consume or require large bandwidth to upload and/or download over the Internet. The rapid adoption of this distributed file system is in part because IPFS is designed to operate on top of different protocols, such as FTP and HTTP. However, there are underpinning concerns relating to security and access control, for example lack of traceability on how the files are accessed. The aim of this paper is to complement IPFS with blockchain technology, by proposing a new approach (BlockIPFS) to create a clear audit trail. BlockIPFS allows us to achieve improved trustworthiness of the data and authorship protection, and provide a clear route to trace back all activities associated with a given file using blockchain as a service.",

        "Abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

        "Abstract": "While the Bitcoin and Ethereum are still leading the world of permissionless blockchains, we are increasingly seeing a multipolar ecosystem where new blockchains keep emerging instead of migrating to the two big players. As a result, it is highly desired to enable multiple blockchains to interoperate, e.g., move assets from one blockchain to the other. The crosschain bridge service, as a solution to the blockchain interoperability problem, has been offered by a wide range of service providers. However, the existing bridges either rely on centralised notaries or require complicated preparations, therefore are far from sufficient in practice. In this demo proposal, we highlight the Poly Bridge for heterogeneous blockchains to interoperate with cryptocurrencies. In specific, Poly Bridge is based on an un-derlying Poly Chain and a pair of relays to confirm crosschain transactions and form consensus among relevant parties. More importantly, Poly Bridge delivers extensibility to flexibly inter-face to blockchains with different consensus models and atomicity as well in a way that a sequence of crosschain operations are either all confirmed or all rejected. Poly Bridge is now available as a web application to support crosschain requests with over 200 types of cryptocurrencies on 18 blockchains.",

This technology is raising a lot of interest both in academia and industry, but the lack of tools to evaluate design and implementation decisions may hamper fast progress. To address this issue, this paper presents a discrete-event simulator that is flexible enough to evaluate different blockchain implementations. These blockchains can be rapidly modeled and simulated by extending existing models. Running Bitcoin and Ethereum simulations allowed us to change conditions and answer different questions about their performance. For example, we concluded that doubling the number of transactions per block has a low impact on the block propagation delay (10ms) and that encrypting communication has a high impact in that delay (more than 25%).",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain performance cannot meet the requirement nowadays. One of the crucial ways to improve performance is sharding. However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on the public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, multiple-shard contract calling, strict transaction atomicity, and shard availability, which are essential requirements but also challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving flexible multiple-shard contract calling. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. On a test-bed of 128 AliCloud servers, setting 32 shards and 4 consortium members, Meepo-OpenEtheruem can achieve more than 140,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions. It also shows more than 50,000 TPS under the transactions of real-world shopping behaviors.",

They furthermore offer benefits in data immutability and traceability, as blockchains are cryptographically secured. However, the performance of blockchain-based systems in real-time grid monitoring and control has never been empirically tested. This study proposes implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm using blockchain-based smart contracts, as a testbed for evaluating the performance of blockchains in real-time control. We furthermore investigate sharding mechanisms as a means of improving the system's scalability with fixed computing resources. We implement our models as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain platform, the Matpower library in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and Hyperledger Caliper as our performance evaluation tool. We found that sharding does indeed lead to a substantial improvement in system scalability for this domain, measured by both transaction success rates and transaction latency.",

SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.",

        "Abstract": "Improvements in fabrication devices such as 3D printers are becoming possible for personal fabrication to freely fabricate any products. To clarify who is liable for the product, the fabricator should keep the fabrication history in an immutable and sustainably accessible manner. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, \"Fabchain,\" that can record the fabrication history in such a manner. By utilizing a scheme that employs a blockchain as an auditable communication channel, Fabchain manages print jobs for the fabricator\u2019s 3D printer over the blockchain, while maintaining a history of a print job. We implemented Fabchain on Ethereum and evaluated the performance for recording a print job. Our results demonstrate that Fabchain can complete communication of a print job sequence in less than 1 minute on the Ethereum test network. We conclude that Fabchain can manage a print job in a reasonable duration for 3D printing, while satisfying the requirements for immutability and sustainability.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains have attracted a great deal of attention as a technology for the distributed management of register information at multiple nodes without a centralized system. However, they possess the drawbacks of low transaction throughput and long approval time. These problems can be addressed by shortening the block generation interval; however, shortening this interval alone has the effect of increasing the frequency of forks. In this study, we aim to shorten the block generation interval without increasing the fork generation rate by improving the network topology of the nodes and shortening the propagation time. We propose a neighbor node selection method forming a network topology with a short block propagation time. A blockchain simulator is used to demonstrate the effect of the proposed neighbor node selection method on the propagation delay of the network. This result indicates that the proposed method improves block propagation time.",

        "Title": "Proof of Authenticity of Logistics Information with Passive RFID Tags and Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "When tracing large (robotically automated) logistics, passive RFID tags are preferred because of their low cost. Therefore, among the many challenges of RFID, security between such a tag and a reader was the main area of research. Yet, the authenticity of data cannot be assured if the service releases falsified information to users either intentionally or by accident. Applying blockchain in supply chains is often referred to and even tested, but it just writes records as instructed, and there is a risk of falsified records being written in the first place. Thus, we propose a design in which a tamper-evident, location-limited, and digitally signing reader writes digital evidence into a blockchain service in an atomic (indivisible) fashion, as they report that a tag is read or written. This allows integrity and confidentiality of the logistics information maintained throughout the system, even if the private keys or signature algorithms are compromised, or the public key certificates expire. To show that our proposal is feasible, we present a prototype design. As a result, the authenticity of logistics information using inexpensive passive tags can be assured. Moreover, this solution can also be applied to IoT (Internet of Things) in general.",

The model mainly consists of two kinds of intelligent agents: music propagation environment and music propagation intelligent agent. The attributes of music propagation intelligent agent are mainly divided into the degree of propagation willingness, the probability of propagation, the frequency of propagation and their own ranks. The attributes of music propagation environment are the participation degree of music propagation intelligent agent. The two kinds of intelligent agents realize music communication mainly according to the interactive rules of music information propagation. It is found in the study that the greater the value of music information, the more the number of music propagation agents are; the faster the speed of music information transmission among music propagation intelligent agents becomes, the greater the value of music information is and the more obviously the willingness of the propagation groups rises. In comparison with similar propagation models, the music communication model based on intelligent agent has faster transmission efficiency and higher application value.",

However, most blockchain sharding research focuses on public blockchain. As for consortium blockchain, previous studies cannot support high cross-shard efficiency, cross-contract flexibility, shard availability, and strict transaction atomicity, which are the essential requirements but also the challenges in consortium blockchain systems. Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving cross-contract flexibility. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness. We implement Meepo on the AliCloud, using 32 shards in maximum, achieving more than 120,000 cross-shard TPS under the workload of 100,000,000 asset transactions.",

        "Title": "A Certificateless Consortium Blockchain for IoTs",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain is multi-centralized, immutable and traceable, thus is very suitable for distributed storage, privacy and security management in IoTs. However, most existing researches focus on the integration of public blockchain and IoTs. In fact, problems such as slow consensus, low transmission throughput, and completely open storage on the public blockchain are intolerable in IoT scenarios. Although consortium blockchain represented by Hyperledger Fabric has improved the transmission rate, its data security completely relies on the PKI-based certificate mechanism, resulting in transmission inefficiency and privacy leakage. In this paper, a key-derived Controllable Lightweight Secure Certificateless Signature (CLS 2 ) algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the transmission efficiency and keep similar computation overhead of consortium blockchain. Compared with the existing certificateless signatures, CLS 2 achieves more secure transactions, whose controllable anonymity and key-derived mechanism not only prevents public key replacement attacks and forged signature attacks, but also supports hierarchical privacy protection. Armed with CLS 2 , we design a consortium blockchain security architecture based on Hyper-ledger Fabric and edge computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of certificateless signature in consortium blockchain. We formally prove the security of our schemes in the random oracle model. Specifically, the security of the proposed scheme is reduced to the Elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Security analysis and experiments in IoT scenarios verify the feasibility and effectiveness of CLS 2 .",

        "Abstract": "Today, several solutions for cross-blockchain asset transfers exist. However, these solutions are either tailored to specific assets or neglect finality guarantees that prevent assets from getting lost in transit. In this paper, we present a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol that supports arbitrary assets and adheres to finality requirements. The ability to freely transfer assets between blockchains may increase transaction throughput and provide developers with more flexibility by allowing them to design digital assets that leverage the capacities and capabilities of multiple blockchains.",

Similarly, there is an increasing interest in adopting blockchain as a new solution to addressing educational credentialing problems. However, none of the existing blockchain initiatives in educational credentialing seems to meet their original goal of global adoption. Based on the Australian tertiary education credentialing industry, this paper presents an abstract credentialing workflow and involved stakeholders, identifies six practical problems in the industry, and proposes five desired attributes of ideal credentials infrastructure. In addition, the paper presents a layered framework for evaluating seven blockchain-based education projects, and provides insights into factors hindering the wide adoption of these blockchain solutions. Finally, we suggest future considerations for the application development of blockchain-based education solutions.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology that brings transparency in a scalable way for multiple organizations and this is thanks to its several features. There are some exciting blockchain features but among them, decentralization is undoubtedly the most interesting one. Organizations can share data within a distributed ledger. As a consequence, each one can access synchronized data stored in its local Blockchain node. This functionality improves transaction tracking and facilitates access to data within a private group of organizations. However, in some cases, even if organizations accept to share data, they require to hide some private information related to their users or their business model. To tackle privacy and trust issues between organizations, this paper presents a blockchain architecture based on the proxy re-encryption scheme. This scheme is integrated within smart contracts to provide a very efficient, fast, and secure platform. The proposed architecture is implemented in an Hyperledger Blockchain and tested in a real transport and mobility use case.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has positively impacted traceability across various industries such as logistics and shipping. By overcoming the problem of data silos among organizations and concentration of authority, this innovative approach allows a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger to be built. On the other hand, the use of non-fungible tokens, a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, is expected to be able to represent complicated operations in traceability systems. However, the existing token design lacks an efficient model for retrieval of past histories. The most popular way to retrieve past information on tokens is to use blockchain explorers, which are centralized trusted parties. Otherwise, so far there is only a naive way to examine all block headers, and it takes a vast amount of time. Our preliminary study shows that the processing time for retrieving all histories of 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet takes approximately 57 minutes. We propose a new token design based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that allows token histories to be efficiently explored without examining the whole blockchain. The model associates each state of the token from past to latest and covers expressions of relationships between tokens, such as merge and split. Our implementation and evaluation reveal that the DAG-based token design significantly improves the efficiency of exploring token transfer histories. The results show that our method can complete the exploration for 1,030 tokens in a matter of seconds and maintains performance over the long term even if the blockchain grows.",

        "Abstract": "Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Blockchain technology has enabled a new kind of distributed system. It has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the socalled Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, academia has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomenon. In this talk, we aim to shed light on the state of the DAO ecosystem. For doing so, we will review the three main platforms that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs nowadays: Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus. We will introduce their main similarities and differences, compare their adoption and how they are evolving. We will also review some statistics about the DAOs that these platforms host. This overview will also help us to understand which kind of communities are populating the blockchain and what are the similarities and differences with other online communities.",

From the simple Bitcoin that can only be transferred at first to the blockchain application ecology that is now blooming, blockchain is gradually building a credible internet of value. However, with the continuous development and application of blockchain, even the blockchain based on cryptography is facing a series of network security problems and has caused great property losses to participants. Therefore, studying blockchain security and accelerating standardization of blockchain security have become the top priority to ensure the orderly and healthy development of blockchain technology. This paper briefly introduces the scope of blockchain security from the perspective of network security, sorts out some existing standards related to blockchain security, and gives some suggestions to promote the development and application of blockchain security standardization.",

        "Abstract": "Diverse technologies, such as machine learning and big data, have been driving the prosperity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the ubiquitous proliferation of IoT devices. Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir\u2019s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB\u2019s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto\u2019s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.",

        "Abstract": "In many organizations, permissioned blockchain networks are currently transitioning from a proof-of-concept stage to production use. A crucial part of this transition is ensuring awareness of potential threats to network operations. Due to the plethora of software components involved in distributed ledgers, threats may be difficult or impossible to detect without a structured monitoring approach. To this end, we conduct a survey of attacks on permissioned blockchains and develop a set of threat indicators. To gather these indicators, a data processing pipeline is proposed to aggregate log information from relevant blockchain components, enriched with data from external sources. To evaluate the feasibility of monitoring current blockchain frameworks, we determine relevant data sources in Hyperledger Fabric. Our results show that the required data is mostly available, but also highlight significant improvement potential with regard to threat intelligence, chaincode scanners and built-in metrics.",

        "Abstract": "The growing popularity of Blockchain networks attracts also malicious and hacking users. Effectively detecting inappropriate and malicious activity should thus be a top priority for safeguarding blockchain networks and services. Blockchain behavior analysis can be used to detect unusual account activities or time periods with network-wide irregular properties. Thus, optimized anomaly detection based on historical data is an essential task for securing transactions and services. However, processing the complete blockchain history can be slow and costly due to its large size and rapid growth. In this paper we suggest addressing this challenge by analyzing summarized blocks data structures, called sketches, rather than the entire blockchain. Sketches are common data structures used in computer systems and blockchain networks, to allow compact data representation while supporting efficient executions of particular queries. We study how sketches can be used to detect suspicious accounts or time periods without the need to maintain or go through the entire blockchain data. We design solutions for the major known attacks and conduct experiments to evaluate them based on real Ethereum data. We compare the accuracy, run-time and memory usage of our algorithms with traditional detection algorithms relying on the complete blockchain data. Our results indicate that sketch-based anomaly detection methods can provide a practical scalable solution for detecting anomalies in blockchain networks.",

To address these problems. We propose an accountable CP-ABE mechanism based on block chain system. First, we establish two authorization agencies MskCA and AttrVN(Attribute verify Network),where the MskCA can realize master key escrow, and the AttrVN manages and validates users' attributes. In this way, our system can avoid the single point of failure and improve the privacy of user attributes and security of keys. Moreover, in order to realize auditability of CP-ABE key parameter transfer, we introduce the did and record parameter transfer process on the block chain. Finally, we theoretically prove the security of our CP-ABE. Through comprehensive comparison, the superiority of CP-ABE is verified. At the same time, our proposed schemes have some properties such as fast decryption and so on.",

        "Title": "BLOCKEYE: Hunting for DeFi Attacks on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Decentralized finance, i.e., DeFi, has become the most popular type of application on many public blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) in recent years. Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participantsfunds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before. A video of BLOCKEYE is available at https://youtu.be/7DjsWBLdlQU.",

With the booming development of blockchain in recent years, blockchain technology provides a new solution in the field of e-voting. Multi-District election is an important method of election in real life, e.g. in US presidential election. Inspired by the electoral college system, we propose a blockchain-based e-voting scheme for multi-district election. First, we propose a blockchain-based voter registration method that all voters are authenticated by the blockchain system. Second, we design a two-layer blockchain architecture, where the lower layer records the votes of voters in each district and the higher layer records the votes of electors. Then we describe the voting process and evaluate the security and availability of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can satisfy the needs of multi-district election.",

        "Title": "Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Multi-Keyword Search over Encrypted Data on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated searchable blockchains that not only provide reliable search over encrypted distributed storage systems but ensure privacy is preserved. Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has attracted lots of attention in recent years. However, the performance of blockchain cannot meet the requirement of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the important bottlenecks of blockchain is the limited computing resources on a single server while executing transactions. To address this issue, we propose Aeolus blockchain to achieve the distributed execution of blockchain transactions. There are two key challenges to achieving this for IoT blockchain: transaction structure and state consistency. Facing these challenges, we first propose a distributed blockchain transaction structure, which imports extra parameters to divide the transaction execution into different stages to enable distributed execution. Second, we propose distributed state update sharding, which equips each blockchain peer with its own master and shard servers. In this way, each blockchain peer can be considered as a cluster that distributes the transaction to shorten the processing time and reach the consensus finally. We implement Aeolus on Go-Ethereum to evaluate its feasibility, on a testbed including 132 cloud servers. Our system runs stably for more than 8 h under the workload of 190 000 000 real-world user transactions. Experimental results show the efficiency that Aeolus can achieve more than 100 000 transactions/s of blockchain transactions, which is 15.6 times the throughput of the original blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has gained considerable traction over the last few years and plays a critical role in realizing decentralized and cryptocurrency applications. A challenge that has been over-looked in prior blockchain algorithms is that they do not consider large-scale network outages and relied on the assumption of a reliable global network connectivity. In the event of a large scale network partition, forks may occur between partitioned regions. After the partition ends they will be discarded, leading to the loss of many blocks and a considerable amount of wasted work. This paper presents PeloPartition, which provides a sharding mechanism to improve blockchain's resilience to the possibility of a global internet outage. In PeloPartition we form consensus groups dynamically and consider the partitioning of the group as a hint to split the blockchain into branches and guarantee that all of them will be merged after the network is recovered. We indicate different methodologies to ensure blockchain security while partitioning occurs. Our experiments use simulations to show how this approach can improve the performance of blockchain algorithms and prevent wasted computational power during partitioning.",

Existing centralized data sharing and access systems provide less transparency and traceability as the users have to trust a centralized authority and its decision making for the entire system. There is a need for decentralized distributed data storage and access without a central authority. Blockchain provides promising solutions to such needs. However, the existing decentralized blockchain-based solutions are complex and involve financial incentives, which limits their applications. We propose a secure permissioned blockchain-based decentralized system, VAULT, with a novel quorum-based consensus. We store encrypted files using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and the references to the files in the blockchain. VAULT is designed for applications involving collaboration from multiple permissioned parties, and users can store, access, and share data as well as manage projects through blockchain. Our experimental results show that our quorum selection is fair, and the VAULT protocol is scalable.",

        "Abstract": "With the emergence of concepts such as Metaverse and Web 3.0, digital identity plays a very important role as one of its infrastructures. The traditional digital identity model is no longer suitable for the requirements of the digital economy to some extent at this stage. The traditional centralized identity management system has many drawbacks. For example, the owner of the digital identity does not actually control his own identity, and there is a risk of easy disclosure and theft of identity information. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof, traceability, etc., which can effectively solve the problems of centralized digital identity. After analyzing and summarizing the evolution trend of digital identity from centralization to decentralization, this paper focuses on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) based on blockchain. Based on the analysis and comparison of various SSI implementation schemes, the development difficulties of blockchain digital identity are summarized and the future development direction is pointed out.",

We apply MLAV to IoT Blockchain applications in Agriculture 4.0 to demonstrate the feasibility of our solutions and models. In the current Agriculture 4.0 structure, large companies have successfully applied blockchain solutions and ecosystems for tracking and tracing agricultural produce, achieving transparency, traceability, and digitalization. However, these existing blockchain solutions are not comprehensive. First, the upstream nodes they serve are all large-scale production suppliers, and smallholders are not taken into consideration. In order to solve this problem, we use a multi-layer architecture that serves three purposes: facilitating smallholders in joining the agricultural blockchain as equal-opportunity nodes, uploading of production activity data, and reducing costs (ex. Ethereum gas fee). Second, the majority of IoT blockchains adopt an ID-based signature scheme in IoT devices, which frequently has lower efficiency. In applying aggregate verification, we may effectively increase ID-based verification efficiency while processing large clusters of data transferred by IoT devices. Finally, we design a blockchain management framework using smart contracts to facilitate the financing of upstream producers.",

We have witnessed increased growth of non-commercial organizations and public charity funds through recent years, collecting donations for various philanthropic needs. Unfortunately, charity funds frequently gain much traction from the unscrupulous organization, resulting in significant damage for industry's reputation, reducing trust level, affecting the ability to raise donations. We strongly believe that utilizing blockchain technology will boost trust,increase efficiency, and encourage more donations.The Karma-Token project, a blockchain-based charity foundation platform that facilitates the trustful network's formation and is accountable for collecting donation funds. The blockchain network would be comprised of publically known, trustful, and prestigious organizations. All organizations' operations within the platform will become fully transparent and visible, leveraging properties of immutability, provenance, and non-repudiation. Therefore the platform will alleviate the results of dishonest actions, revealing fraudulent organizations' activities.",

        "Abstract": "Machine learning has recently enabled large advances in artificial intelligence, but these tend to be highly centralized. The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and re-train them. We propose a framework for participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to host a continuously updated model. This model will be shared publicly on a blockchain where it can be free to use for inference. Ideal learning problems include scenarios where a model is used many times for similar input such as personal assistants, playing games, recommender systems, etc. In order to maintain the model's accuracy with respect to some test set we propose both financial and non-financial (gamified) incentive structures for providing good data.

After the completion of the ride, the drivers are rated by the riders. There are possibilities that, a malicious rider can claim the refund with a fake complain and give the driver poor rating. Current system is not capable of deciding the correctness of the objections raised by either parties and provides a biased outcome of each objections as per the centralized company's marketing strategies. We present BlockV, a blockchain enabled solution to ensure the fairness of the ride. The creation, completion, dissatisfaction or abortion of any ride will be written in the blockchain ledger, hence will be available to all participants in the peer to peer network. This simultaneously ensures the fairness in maintenance of the inbuilt reputation system.

Efforts are being made to reduce carbon footprint to mitigate such effects. Calculating the carbon footprint of food products is complex and requires the cooperation of all the stakeholders of the food supply chain. A record keeping system for tracking carbon footprint while preserving privacy for the related parties is needed. This paper presents a new implementation of blockchain for tracking of carbon footprint on food production and transportation stages. We designed a system that tracks the carbon footprint of food processing facilities and transportation parties using cluster-based record keeping while preserving their privacy. We implemented the proposed carbon footprint chain and evaluated its throughput and latency under different scenarios. We show that our blockchain implementation is capable of operating with a larger number of nodes without any scalability issues.",

        "Abstract": "In this work, we add secure multiparty computation capabilities to the permissioned blockchain architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, and use them to implement the clearing price mechanism for initial public offering (IPO). As with any blockchain, the core property in Fabric is that all peers must see the same ledger, so using confidential data on the ledger is a challenge. To address this challenge we use cryptographic secure multiparty computation (MPC), which requires that we integrate a few new mechanisms into the Fabric architecture. Specifically we need to let the peers access local information such as their respective secret keys, and also send messages to each other while executing smart contracts. We also had to add to Fabric a library that implements the required cryptographic tools, and to make that library accessible from the smart contracts. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this solution by using it to implement the clearing price mechanism for IPOs. We designed an efficient cryptographic protocol for the IPO clearing price mechanism, and used our integrated system to run it on Fabric. Although not fully optimized yet, the performance of the resulting implementation is more than fast enough for this particular application, ranging from 8 to 23 seconds to execute an IPO sale.",

Blockchain differs from conventional server-based systems in that it is tamper-resistant and highly available. However, the advantages of blockchain also work to the advantage of attackers. There is an area in the blockchain where users can embed arbitrary data via transactions, and prior works have shown that this area can be exploited for botnet C&C communications. In order to analyze what other types of attacks could develop from the contamination of the blockchain, we constructed specific attack scenarios and analyzed the ease of such attacks by conducting demonstrations experiments. We also proposed countermeasures against the attack scenarios and verified the effectiveness of these by conducting demonstration experiments.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, the rapid development of cryptocurrencies and their underlying blockchain technology has revived Szabo\u2019s original idea of smart contracts, i.e., computer protocols that are designed to automatically facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation and implementation of digital contracts without central authorities. Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be \u201cThe DAO Attack\u201d in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary\u2019s account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts. This paper is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.",

However, there is currently a lack of guidance on a structured DevOps approach and a breakdown of the specifics in the context of blockchain-based software development. Therefore, we combined gray literature and DevOps application studies from pertinent GitHub projects to systematically investigate current practices and solution approaches for an efficient blockchain-oriented DevOps procedure. In this process, we elaborated procedural steps and related activities according to the main stages of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Our research shows that core DevOps concepts and activities are similar to other areas and are entirely possible with already established CI/CD solutions that orchestrate the right tools, with the difference that more rigorous testing and differentiated deployment practices are required due to the inherent immutability of blockchain.",

        "Abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains add blocks, and consequently the chain weight, randomly. The blocks added also have a significant network delay owing to their large size. Large delay combined with randomness causes forks that are responsible for many security problems. One can reduce fork occurrences by designing a system with large block intervals and size but this design compromises performance aspects such as confirmation time guarantees. The trade-off between security and performance in PoW blockchain is a well discussed topic in the literature. In this paper, we aim to reduce the conflict between security and performance through our novel concept of Links. Links are small, fast and frequent structures that can be incorporated on any new or existing PoW blockchains. Links help reduce the confirmation time of its underlying blockchain while preserving its consistency security guarantees. Our novel lower-bound growth rate for PoW systems with links in the presence of a general adversary in a partially synchronous network, shows that links provide a more steady chain growth rate than classic PoW systems without links. On a well-established, secure system like Bitcoin, we use the derived growth rate to show that when links are incorporated to Bitcoin, they help reduce its confirmation time from 60 minutes by half to 30 minutes, while retaining the consistency threshold guarantees of the original Bitcoin system. We provide a proof of concept emulation of links in a Bitcoin test bed consisting of 210 nodes having real world latencies between them. We benchmark a system with links against Bitcoin to show links cause negligible network overheads and no compromises on security in terms of orphaned weight due to forks. Our theoretical analyses and experiments can easily be extended to other Nakamoto style PoW systems.",

        "Abstract": "In a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, all nodes need to be able to recognize approximately synchronized clocks. A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, the demand for global identifiers has rapidly increased since IoT devices are widely used around the world. This indicates that we need to build a scalable and secure identification system. A blockchain is effective to resolve global identifier conflicts and to prove the legitimacy of the identifiers. However, the blockchain replication cost may become a bottleneck when allocation requests increase. Here, we propose a blockchain-based scalable allocation system for a ubiquitous code (ucode), which is a standardized global numerical identifier. In our system, a registrar bundles ucode allocation requests into a single transaction to reduce the replication cost. Based on the blockchain data generated from the transaction, the owner of each ucode space can provide a proof to claim his ownership. The proof mechanism requires registrants to wait for receiving proof data from the registrar. We analyze the trade-off between the waiting time and ucode allocation scalability. We also compare our proposal with the conventional methods and find that the proposed method enables more registrants to claim ucode ownerships.",

        "Title": "StreamChain: Building a Low-Latency Permissioned Blockchain For Enterprise Use-Cases",
        "Abstract": "Permissioned blockchains are a promising technology for secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains, which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in controlled environments with fast networking and low latency. However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinking behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latency several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. In this work, we propose a fundamental shift in permissioned blockchain design, eliminating blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion. This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees. To demonstrate the wide applicability of our design, we prototype StreamChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric, and show that it delivers latency two orders of magnitude lower than Fabric, while sustaining similar throughput. This performance makes StreamChain a potential alternative to traditional databases and, thanks to its streaming paradigm, enables further research, for instance, around reducing latency through relying on modern programmable hardware accelerators.",

        "Title": "Setchain: Improving Blockchain Scalability with Byzantine Distributed Sets and Barriers",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of the chain of blocks (and of the transactions within each block). However, total order is often overkilling, since important advanced applications of smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order (instead of a total order) can be exploited. In this paper, we propose a distributed concurrent data type, called Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain implements a grow-only set object whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of the latest elements added. Therefore, two operations in the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers, since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total order. Moreover, since the Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many smart contract solutions with much faster operations than on basic blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "This investigation focuses on the performance analysis of one of the most nascent Blockchain frameworks, Hyperledger Iroha. This paper evaluates the performance of the Hyperledger Iroha framework based on three parameters: (a) total requests per seconds (RPS) over time; (b) response times in milliseconds over time; and (c) number of users in the network over time. The results indicate that the integration of Hyperledger Iroha with a major livestock management and trading platform in the UK, can support at least 200 participants with no errors in the network. Additionally, the total requests per second can reach as high as 40.6, and the response times are in the order of a fraction of a second. This research and its results can assist scholars and practitioners regarding selection of an ideal Blockchain framework for their problem setting.",

        "Abstract": "Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model is an efficient solution that not only solves the problem of the agricultural product's origin but also provides a method to share the market risk between consumers and producers. In the CSA model, consumers order and pay for products in advance. Then, the producers will send packages of fresh products to consumers after a fixed period corresponding to the paid amount. However, the critical weakness of the CSA model is the lack of solutions for both sides to demonstrate the product's quality, which makes consumers unsure about the condition of receiving products. In consequence, consumers become hesitant to order and pay money in advance. In this paper, we will propose a novel solution that allows consumers to track their products through agricultural diaries recorded by farmers every day. The key difference of the proposed solution is to leverage Blockchain technology advantages in authenticating and protecting the integrity of information. Such that, consumers could track all steps in the production process quickly and reliably. Meanwhile, producers can build and increase their enterprise branding by transferring product information transparently and responsibly.",

        "Abstract": "Both the number of blockchains and the discovered number of applications of blockchain are ever-increasing. Understanding how different blockchains compare in performance has become more important than ever, yet each blockchian paper uses its own inconsistent standards for performance analysis. There are few mechanisms that may allow for consistent performance analysis among multiple blockchains. This paper details the implementation of the first-ever multi-layer blockchain parameter tuning system: Parameter Space Exploration. Our system is primarily targeted at the performance issue but also takes into consideration power consumption. Multi-layer blockchains use a permissioned blockchain to solve performance deficits. We find that the side chain is the determining factor for the performance of a multi-layer system; our side chain is chosen among a set of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Crash Fault Tolerance (CFT) based consensus algorithms as they are more energy-efficient and have higher performance than their Proof of Work (PoW) counterparts. Our proposed Parameter Space Exploration has two elements: (1) The concept of a parameter space; (2) A side-by-side benchmarking system for balanced comparison among different multi-layer blockchains and consensus algorithms.",

        "Abstract": "Suppose that Alice plans to buy a physical good from Bob over a programmable Blockchain. Alice does not trust Bob, so she is not willing to pay before the good is delivered off-chain. Similarly, Bob does not trust Alice, so he is not willing to deliver the good before getting paid on-chain. Moreover, they are not inclined to use the services of a trusted third-party. Traditionally, such scenarios are handled by game-theoretic escrow smart contracts, such as BitHalo. In this work, we first show that the common method for this problem suffers from a major flaw which can be exploited by Bob in order to extort Alice. We also show that, unlike the case of auctions, this flaw cannot be addressed by a commitment-scheme-based approach. We then provide a much more general result: assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.**A preprint of this work appeared in [1].",

In this paper, we discuss how to design a traceability system for rare Chinese herbal medicine with double-chain structure by using the high efficiency of private blockchain and the extensibility of consortium blockchain to store the detailed information of each process in the interplanetary file system (IPFS), store the Hash value of each production process traceability information in the private blockchain, and record the transaction identification ID in the private blockchain in the previous stage in the traceability information in the next stage, so that consumers can get the complete traceability information of rare Chinese herbal medicines by combining the traceability information of the sales stage with the IPFS. By linking the Hash value of the traceability information of the final sales stage to the consortium blockchain as a transaction, the safety and reliability of the scheme are enhanced. The private blockchain is used to collect and track the traceability information, while the consortium blockchain is to tamper with and verify the traceability information.",

        "Abstract": "In the past few years, cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications has been one of the most rapidly emerging fields of computer science, leading to a strong demand of software applications. Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US$), Bitfinex in 2016 (72 million US$), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.",

We envision a marketplace for IoT data streams that can unlock such potential value in a scalable way, by enabling any pairs of data providers and consumers to engage in data exchange transactions without any prior assumption of mutual trust. We present a marketplace model and architecture to support trading of streaming data, from the advertising of data assets to the stipulation of legally binding trading agreements, to their fulfilment and payment settlement. Crucially, we show that by using blockchain technology and Smart Contracts in particular, we can offer participants a trade-off between the cost of transactional data exchange, and the risk of data loss when trading with untrusted third parties. We experimentally assess such trade-offs on a testbed using Ethereum Smart Contracts.",

        "Abstract": "Employment and workforce industry become more important because the human capital value is linked to the company's profitability. Company becomes employee-centric in the 21st century. To hire an appropriate employee, and reduce hiring liability workplace violence, background screening marketing growth quickly. However, in the human resource industry, background check still is a pain point, especially for employment, education, and skill verification. The traditional background check is prolonged and inaccurate. For overseas recruitment, background check will be more troublesome. This paper comprehensively addresses the challenge of the education, employment and skill verification problem. We propose an innovation E^2 C-Chain which is a two-stage blockchain based education, employment and skill certification system. In the first stage, the new blocks are created when a trust organization verifies the education and employment information of the employee. In the second stage, to encourage the verifiers to participate in the skill verification process, we employ a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) game based incentive mechanism to find the Nash Equilibrium and ensure social cost minimization. We also present the theoretical proofs and extensive simulations to demonstrate beneficial properties and efficiency of our proposed system.",

Care must be taken when handling such sensitive data to protect the data owners' privacy while guaranteeing the integrity when the data is accessed by a third party. Furthermore, data should be available without much delay to support medical emergencies. Unfortunately, IoT devices may be limited with storage and computational resources to operate highly secure operations and respond to data requests. In this paper, we propose SSP, a novel mechanism that protects the privacy and integrity of the data collected by IoT devices without having a single point of failure, while minimizing the cryptographic operations that must be performed on IoT devices. SSP utilizes the blockchain data structure for availability and integrity, and Multi-Party-Computations (MPC) for privacy protection. We implemented SSP in C/C++ and according to our evaluation results, SSP is efficient in computation, communication, and storage operations on IoT devices.",

        "Abstract": "To make a time capsule on the Internet, which will be opened at a planned time in the future, without third parties' involvement has always been a difficult problem. Although there are many researches worked on various time-lock systems, they may have some shortcomings like uncertainty in decryption time, not fully decentralized, hard to estimate the required computing resources. In this paper, we proposed a protocol and a reliable encryption scheme to make time-sensitive message be opened on time at a fully decentralized environment, which is then integrated with the blockchain to adapt to different computing power situations. The method also provides the capability of incorporating with appropriate incentives for encouraging participants to contribute their computing resources, which makes our system more suitable for real world applications.",

        "Abstract": "Public service organisations (PSOs) have a need to collaborate with each other in order to provide a seamless user experience, mitigate fraud and increase operational efficiency at a reduced tax payer's cost. However, legacy systems built over decades using different technology stacks, make collaboration challenging and hinder efficiency. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) have been proposed as a trust and efficiency mechanism for several inter organisation collaborative tasks. They can reduce friction in operations and help achieve a more streamlined and unified public service infrastructure. However, most of the work are either based on theory or purely conceptual and lack implementation. In this paper, we elaborate on the design and implementation of a proof of concept (POC) of a blockchain based interoperability and data sharing system that allows PSOs to seamlessly collaborate and share information in real time. The POC is based on the Registration of Overseas Entities and Beneficial Owners (ROEBO) legislation in the UK and demonstrates interactions between Companies House UK and other PSOs in a hybrid blockchain setting.",

        "Abstract": "The fast digital transformation the world experienced in the past few decades has created a multitude of information resources distributed over the Internet and accessed by many different entities. The sharing of these resources needs to be secure and trustworthy to protect the privacy of data and data providers. Privacy and reliability are major concerns especially in blockchain-based data storage systems, as data are held by different owners. Each data provider tries to increase its share of profit by collaborating with other data providers. To ensure secure data sharing in such a decentralized environment, authentication and verification of shared data is needed. This paper proposes a mutual authentication mechanism based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) using hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) to provide anonymity and integrity during the communication process in blockchain-based data sharing. To evaluate the fairness of profit sharing based on data providers' contributions and data utility, we propose the use of the Shapley value techniques. The performed security analysis demonstrates that our proposed approach is resilient against replay, secret disclosure, and traceability attacks.",

        "Abstract": "As Multi-Agent Systems, Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) require mechanisms for the allocation of tasks to multiple agents such as workstations or mobile robots. One approach is market-based task allocation (TA) which faces challenges related to fraud and intransparency. Integrating blockchain technology (BCT) into TA enables transparency and tamper resistance. It also allows for the downstream integration of financial transactions in CPPS. This paper proposes a method for two-stage market-based TA in CPPS enabled by BCT. A formal definition for a reverse first-price-sealed-bid auction including the payment process is presented for the blockchain-based two-stage auctioning in a CPPS. The proposed method is implemented in a prototype and tested with a focus on scalability. Transaction times and costs are considered within the experiments. The evaluation reveals that the proposed process is functionable and that financial transactions can be completely automated within CPPS. The time and gas usage of transactions scale in most scenarios and only take a few seconds for completion.",

        "Abstract": "Multi-factor challenge-set self-sovereign identity authentication (MFFSIA) is an important part for establishing trust between systems, devices, organizations and humans for the emerging machine-to-everything (M2X) economy. Most systems for identity authentication (IA) are single sign-on (SSO), or have fixed challenge sets of limited degree. Additionally, IA systems are controlled by governments, or corporations that are closely affiliated with government entities. The available systems for self-sovereign IA do not offer the necessary flexible configurability of challenge sets. Based on research publications about a formal MFSSIA protocol, this paper presents a blockchain employing implementation for a running case assuming different smart-contract blockchain systems must be connected for sensitive data exchange.

        "Abstract": "Permissioned Blockchain systems rely mainly on Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols to establish consensus on the order of transactions. While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f+1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.",

However, during the construction and operation of 5G, telecom operators face many challenges, such as insufficient frequency resources, low efficiency of network management, information opacity, risks of data interoperability, and network privacy vulnerabilities. As 5G is generally deployed in heterogeneous networks with massive ubiquitous devices, it is quite necessary to provide secure and decentralized solutions. Blockchain is a distributed system maintained by multiple parties with inherit features including decentralization, traceability and tamperproof. These features collectively contribute to a new application ecosystem where transactions are secure and trustworthy. Therefore, blockchain is expected to integrate with 5G networks to build safer and more reliable mobile network infrastructures. This paper firstly discusses the merits of blockchain technology and the benefits of integrating it with 5G networks. Then a variety of applications of blockchain technology in telecom network operation are reviewed, including spectrum sharing, international roaming settlement, network operation management, number selection management and supply chain management. In the end, we show our recently advance in integrating blockchain in 5G by introducing a multi framework based blockchain service network architecture deployed in real environment.",

Many studies have been carried out in order to use this technology in the financial industry, but there are still issues regarding scalability that need to be resolved before the technology can be used. In the literature there are works that perform Blockchain performance analysis of the private model, making comparisons between different platforms. However, no work was found regarding the analysis of the impact that changing parameters has on the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In this context, this article introduces PriBB that contributes to the literature regarding the proposal of a benchmark to evaluate the performance of private model Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on the impact that the parameters of block size and interval between blocks have on the performance of applications, since no equivalent work has been found in the literature. The PriBB was evaluated in a real data center environment and aims to assist in the optimization of parameterization of Blockchain applications of the private model. The results are promising and demonstrate that a given parameter can impact more than 100 times the performance in running Blockchain applications.",

        "Title": "Enabling Privacy and Traceability in Supply Chains using Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proofs",
        "Abstract": "In recent years there have been increased efforts to make supply chains transparent and traceable to better protect the end consumer's interests against counterfeiting, contamination, false claims, and inadequate processes. The actors in the supply chain can also leverage additional visibility to proactively tune their operations in response to upstream or downstream disruptions. Blockchain technology, with its promise of immutability, transparency, and provenance is a natural fit to supply chain problems. Several works have discussed the improved design of supply chains leveraging blockchain technology. There have been attempts to address some of the privacy concerns of participants on the blockchain network by using encryption schemes to hide confidential data and group signatures to hide the participant identities. But these do not handle the complexities of the supply chain, where items are constantly packaged, repackaged, and transformed before reaching the end consumer. Our work presents a blockchain-based model for the supply chain that provides privacy and traceability with efficient contamination tracing while accounting for the aforementioned complexities of the supply chain operations. The last property enables an end consumer to be convinced about a product to be unaffected by identified faulty upstream processes (contamination) without access to the entire history of the product. Our solution makes novel use of cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic accumulators to provide these guarantees. The choice of the cryptographic components is grounded in concrete efficiency, and we present an experimental evaluation of the implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular platform for enterprise blockchains.",

        "Title": "Context-based consensus for appendable-block blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g., smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.",

        "Title": "Region-based Neighbor Selection in Blockchain Networks",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain networks are mainly used in financial verification processes, the most famous of which is the Bitcoin network consisting of a huge number of nodes. Expansion of blockchain technology, however, to other areas, such as healthcare, arts, culture, and entertainment, is being considered internationally. Especially important challenges for ensuring the reliability of blockchain networks and the security of peer-to-peer networks are shortening the block propagation times throughout a blockchain network to reduce fork and preventing malicious eclipse attacks against targeted nodes in a network. Previous methods have tried to increase the block propagation speed at the expense of imposing a higher burden on each node and a higher risk of eclipse attack. This paper proposes a new neighbor selection method based on the neighbor's regional information. That is, each node has a relatively small number neighbors located outside its region. By using this simple method, the distribution of blocks throughout the network becomes faster and the random neighbor selection nature in a blockchain network is kept intact; thus, risk of eclipse attack is low.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain-based applications have been recently introduced in communication networks. Different applications require different levels of service whereas existing blockchain-based applications mostly provide a single class of service. In this paper, we propose a multi-class blockchain services (MCBS) framework that prioritizes the processing of time-critical blockchain-based applications in communication networks. We model MCBS as a queueing system and derive the average service times for the different classes. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the average service time and aggregate transactions arrival rate. The numerical results show that existing blockchains may not satisfy the requirements of time-critical applications whereas a high priority queue in MCBS may meet the requirement. In addition, we analyze MCBS under double-spend attacks and show that with maximum attacker hash power, the blockchain system can still be stable if the aggregate transaction arrival rate is lower than half of its maximum achievable value.",

        "Title": "Agent-based Modelling of Bitcoin Consensus without Block Rewards",
        "Abstract": "Trust is key to the efficient functioning of any fiat or crypto-currency and so is for the consensus algorithm behind the functioning of blockchain systems. By an arbitrary design choice, Bitcoin and most Proof-of- Work (PoW) blockchains have a limited supply. Once block rewards vanish, only transaction fees will remain as an incentive for miners to partake in the verification process. In this paper, we analyse the impact that miners bargaining over block composition has on consensus in the absence of block rewards: in this situation, competing blocks at the same height may be more attractive to peers by including less transactions (i.e. sharing the mempool). The mining and acceptance of blocks can be modelled as an Ulti-matum Game, where miners' strategies represent their fairness sentiment. Extending previous Literature, our study focuses on the effect of the transaction arrival rate on global consensus in the system and whether local consensus is formed under certain assumptions about the strategies of miners. We find that consensus is threatened when the supply of transactions is low and stable consensus only emerges when the amount of unconfirmed transactions remains sufficient. In addition, when miners are set with randomised strategies, it is more difficult for the system to achieve consensus. Our research suggests that transitioning from a block reward incentive to a transaction fee incentive may weaken and even destroy the consensus of PoW-based systems.",

Blockchain technology along with incentive and penalty mechanisms have been suggested to counter these. In this paper, we explore verifiable off-chain computations using zero-knowledge proofs as an alternative to incentive and penalty mechanisms in blockchain-based federated learning. In our solution, learning nodes, in addition to their computational duties, act as off-chain provers submitting proofs to attest computational correctness of param-eters that can be verified on the blockchain. We demonstrate and evaluate our solution through a health monitoring use case and proof-of-concept implementation leveraging the ZoKrates language and tools for smart contract-based on-chain model management. Our research introduces verifiability of correctness of learning processes, thus advancing blockchain-based federated learning.",

        "Abstract": "One of the backbone technology of Blockchains is cryptography. In simpler terms cryptography is the mathematical art of secret writing, however it's applications are not limited to writing secret codes only. Essentially cryptography is used to achieve three main security goals namely confidentiality (in-formation must be hidden from the unintended users), integrity (information must be prevented from illicit modifications) and availability (information must be readily available to intended users at all times). In cryptography confidentiality is achieved by employing a technique called as Encryption, integrity is achieved by employing special one way functions called as Cryptographic Hash Functions and authentication (process for verifying identity of the sender) is achieved by employing a technique called as Digital Signatures. For better understanding about the working of Blockchain it is essential to understand cryptographic concepts on which Blockchain is built. This paper presents the brief overview of such cryptographic concepts. In particular this papers throws light on the cryptographic concepts used to build Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains. Furthermore this paper also throws light on the need and requirements of post-quantum cryptographic primitives for post-quantum Blockchains.",

These applications such as SMS and USSD typically do not benefit from existing multi-factor authentication methods due to the nature of their interaction interfaces and mode of operations. To address this problem, we propose an approach that augments blockchain with multi-factor authentication based on evidence from blockchain transactions combined with risk analysis. A profile of how a user performs transactions is built overtime and is used to analyse the risk level of each new transaction. If a transaction is flagged as high risk, we generate n-factor layers of authentication using past endorsed blockchain transactions. A demonstration of how we used the proposed approach to authenticate critical financial transactions in a blockchain-based asset financing platform is also discussed.",

        "Title": "Reliable, Fair and Decentralized Marketplace for Content Sharing Using Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Content sharing platforms such as Youtube and Vimeo have promoted pay per view models for artists to monetize their content. Yet, artists remain at the mercy of centralized platforms that control content listing and advertisement, with little transparency and fairness in terms of number of views or revenue. On the other hand, consumers are distanced from the publishers and cannot authenticate originality of the content. In this paper, we develop a reliable and fair platform for content sharing without a central facilitator. The platform is built as a decentralized data storage layer to store and share content in a fault-tolerant manner, where the peers also participate in a blockchain network. The blockchain is used to manage content listings and as an auditable and fair marketplace transaction processor that automatically pays out the content creators and the storage facilitators using smart contracts. We demonstrate the system with the blockchain layer built on Hyperledger Fabric and the data layer built on Tahoe-LAFS, and show that our design is practical and scalable with low overheads.",

With the support of blockchain technology, people have shown great enthusiasm and trust in decentralized financial services. However, due to sharing personal information with other institutions, users' privacy and data security will be difficult to be guaranteed. Moreover, various encryption methods such as homomorphic encryption focus on protecting the data stored on the blockchain, but few enhance client-side data security. Motivated by this condition, we develop an image-based privacy-preserving scheme to store users' financial service data as images. Transferring the numerical service data into images ensures that users can comprehend the content and prevent data recognized by the machine. We evaluate our scheme through conducting numerical evaluations from image attack effectiveness and smart contract functions' efficiency analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines specifies a \u2018travel rule\u2019 to prevent illegal usages of virtual assets such as money laundering. Following the travel rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) should exchange personal identity information of originator and beneficiary when transferring virtual assets. In this paper, we propose CODE, a novel decentralized blockchain-based travel rule compliance system. Since blockchain does not need any third party, it can eliminate the possibility of massive data leakage due to centralization. It also ensures secure management of travel rule data. We developed a system that uses Corda as a blockchain platform. According to the characteristics of Corda, data are only shared between related parties. Our system also provides an address-search method to verify the beneficiary's identity in real-time. An originator requests virtual asset transfer using only the beneficiary's virtual asset address. By joining the Corda network and installing the proposed system developed in the form of a CorDapp, any VASP can easily use this system to exchange travel rule data.",

        "Title": "On the Storage Overhead of Proof-of-Work Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have long been criticized for their high computational and storage overhead. Unfortunately, while a number of proposals address the energy consumption of existing Proof-of-Work deployments, little attention has been given so far to remedy the storage overhead incurred by those blockchains. In fact, it seems widely acceptable that full nodes supporting the blockchains have to volunteer hundreds of GBs of their storage, to store and verify all transactions exchanged in the system. In this paper, we explore the solution space to effectively reduce the storage footprint of Proof-of-Work based blockchains. To do so, we analyze, by means of thorough empirical measurements, how existing full blockchain nodes utilize data from the shared ledger to validate incoming transactions/blocks. Based on this analysis, we show that it is possible for full nodes to locally reduce their storage footprint to approximately 15 GB, without any modification to the underlying protocol. We also discuss other client-side strategies to further reduce the storage footprint while incurring negligible computational overhead on the nodes.",

        "Title": "The Energy Footprint of Blockchain Consensus Mechanisms Beyond Proof-of-Work",
        "Abstract": "Popular permissionless distributed ledger technology (DLT) systems using proof-of-work (PoW) for Sybil attack resistance have extreme energy requirements, drawing stern criticism from academia, business and the media. DLT systems building on alternative consensus mechanisms, particularly proof-of-stake (PoS), aim to address this downside. In this paper, we take an initial step towards comparing the energy requirements of such systems to understand whether they achieve this goal equally well. While multiple studies have analysed the energy demands of individual blockchains, little comparative work has been done. We approach this research gap by formalising a basic consumption model for PoS blockchains. Applying this model to six archetypal blockchains generates three main findings. First, we confirm the concerns around the energy footprint of PoW by showing that Bitcoin's energy consumption exceeds the energy consumption of all PoS-based systems analysed by at least three orders of magnitude. Second, we illustrate that there are significant differences in energy consumption among the PoS-based systems analysed, with permissionless systems having a larger energy footprint overall owing to their higher replication factor. Third, we point out that the type of hardware that validators use has a considerable impact on whether the energy consumption of PoS blockchains is comparable with or considerably larger than that of centralised systems.",

The multiple SDP controllers form a blockchain network, and they are responsible for implementing the host authentication and authorization. The authorization policies are defined by the accepting SDP hosts. The policy can be recorded into the ledger, and then the authorization is implemented by the SDP controllers in the blockchain. The policy can also be kept by the accepting SDP host because of the privacy preserving, and then the authorization is implemented by the accepting SDP hosts themselves. The blockchain oracles are introduced to support multiple authentication methods defined in SDP.",

        "Title": "Economic Analysis of Blockchain Technology on Digital Platform Market",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology on the platform business becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility, and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers (SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients. The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform business are (i) how SPs' participation is reflected on its quality of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs.",

        "Abstract": "The fast development of Blockchain technology makes it widely applied in several fields of digital transactions, like e-government affairs and the protection of financial transactions. In this article, we propose a homomorphic encryption-based Blockchain for circuit copyright protection that effectively addresses the issues in the protection of circuit copyright transactions, such as low security of private data, low efficiency in transaction data storage, cooperation and supervision. First, we establish a homomorphic encryption-based mathematical model by utilizing Blockchain and intelligent contract, and next, the algorithms that include Blockchain generation, homomorphic chain encryption/decryption, and intelligent contract are designed. As the intelligent contract is correctly executed in Blockchain, a fully homomorphic encryption-based identity authentication protocol is tackled for Blockchain, given that it ensures the change operation of any third-party in Blockchain and realizes real-time verification. The system is apposite for circuit copyright protection in a blockchain network, due to the use of distributed identity authentication and real-time extensible storage improves the security and extensibility of blockchain-based circuit copyright protection. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has reduced the transmission cost and improved the efficiency of data storage and supervision. In addition, it is resilient to several common attacks (e.g., double-spending attacks), yet incurs low cost/overhead and has a higher level of security when compared to three other competing algorithms.",

        "Title": "A Privacy-Preserving Voting Protocol on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-to-end privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.",

The main objective of this research is to present an autonomous solution where users could store their credentials, without depending on TTPs. For this, the use of an autonomous network is imperative, where users could use their uniqueness in order to identify themselves. We propose the framework \u201cThree Blockchains Identity Management with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (3BI-ECC)\u201d. Our proposed framework is a decentralize identity management system where users\u2019 identities are self-generated.",

        "Title": "A Blockchain Proxy for Lightweight IoT Devices",
        "Abstract": "IoT devices are quickly becoming a critical source of information about the physical world considered in business processes. Blockchains are a promising platform for such processes if they involve multiple parties with no shared, commonly trusted IT infrastructure. Transacting with a blockchain, however, requires software whose footprint overwhelms many lightweight IoT devices. In this paper we introduce the concept of a blockchain proxy to which an IoT device can offload a large part of this software footprint. The proxy only requires a slim proxy SDK on the device that holds a regular blockchain identity with its own private key, retaining full control of the transactions in the device. We discuss security implications and present cold-chain monitoring as a use case. Preliminary results show significant savings in CPU time and communication bandwidth for the IoT device.",

        "Title": "Punishment not Reward: Disincentivising Blockchain Application Misbehaviour",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain architectures and applications emerged from the Bitcoin model, and are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. This perception has driven the reward mechanisms for the various kinds of coin mining fueled consensus techniques seen in the vast majority of blockchain applications. As an alternative to reward mechanisms via coin payment, we proposedenial of service to the application in question and/orrevocation of participant confidentiality as punishment mechanisms for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, to be used as part of the incentive mix sustaining the application. This obviates or diminishes the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with all their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem and market manipulation demerits. We emphatically stress the importance of correctly balancing diverseapplication specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications.",

        "Abstract": "Since the introduction of Bitcoin, blockchain has attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry. During the last decade, various large-scale blockchain systems were developed. However, the complexity of large-scale distributed systems makes the performance evaluation process challenging and costly. Here, blockchain simulators give the possibility to repeat complex real-world processes at a low cost. Simulators are easily extensible and can test distributed ledger performance using different settings and parameter variations. This work reviews and summarizes the current status of the state-of-the-art blockchain simulators.",

Blockchain adoption is taking on new heights in other industry verticals. As with any new technological innovation, there are challenges to the acceptance of the value of blockchain technology to the enterprise and the consumer.

Medicalchain uses blockchain technology to securely store patient health records. The first blockchain layer controls access to health records and is built using Hyperledger Fabric.

It explains how to justify implementations of blockchain services and hardware from a financial perspective. When IT architecture consider the economics of a blockchain solution, it is important to realize there are myriad economic decisions that an organization may consider, and those decisions can affect the outcome of a customer meeting significantly. The chapter also explains enterprise concerns related to costing. The costing models used are the capital expenditure and operational expense models. When it comes to blockchains, it is important to understand that most of the cost savings that will be realized will be through implementing \u201cbusiness logic\u201d into smart contracts. The chapter considers some of the typical cost efficiencies that blockchains can introduce into the organization. The cost efficiencies will focus on removing intermediaries that process manual transactions.",

        "Abstract": "The development of smart contract has extended the usage of blockchain technology from a simple ledger database for decentralized cash transaction system into a platform that provides transaction intelligence, and further into a multifunctional state-sharing running platform for designing dependable decentralized applications. However, most current fast-booming blockchain platforms keep bringing new fashion features, which will bring the cost of breaking changes between different releases of the platform. This can be a barrier for developers especially beginners to start their development. To resolve such issue, in this work, we introduce a smart contract development platform called DevLeChain, which comes with unified access method, easy-to-understand development workflow, and constant design philosophy. DevLeChain can provide an easy toolset to customize and control the underlying blockchain's behavior, whereby developers can easily start developing blockchain-based systems. Also, the provided smart contract automation testing tools allow developers to quickly realize their code.",

        "Title": "ClaimChain: Secure Blockchain Platform for Handling Insurance Claims Processing",
        "Abstract": "Insurance claims processing involves multi-domain entities and multi-source data, along with a number of human-agent interactions. Consequently, this processing is traditionally manually-intensive and time-consuming. Blockchain technology-based platforms for intelligent automation can significantly improve the scale and response time of claims processing. However, there is a need to secure such platforms against fraud (e.g., duplicate claims) and the loss of data integrity caused due to cyber-attacks (e.g., Sybil attack). In this paper, we propose a novel \u201cClaimChain\u201d, a consortium Blockchain platform that transforms the state-of-the-art NICB/ISO database architecture approach through increased shared intelligence and participation of insurance companies. ClaimChain features include: (a) automation of insurance claim processing via implementation of a Blockchain infrastructure, (b) infrastructure-level threat modeling via attack tree formalism for data integrity attacks, and (c) application-level fraud modeling for identified prominent red flags through machine learning models and risk scoring on the basis of risk severity. We evaluate the scalability of ClaimChain by simulating realistically large number of Blockchain transactions of claim processing. Further, we show that data integrity attacks at the infrastructure-level can be mitigated (as seen in reduction of 24% probability in loss) through implementation of security design principles. We also perform fraud-detection over an open dataset in ClaimChain to show how machine learning models can detect fraudulent activity with 98% accuracy.",

        "Title": "Yugala: Blockchain Based Encrypted Cloud Storage for IoT Data",
        "Abstract": "Cloud storage enables users to upload, store and download their data. However, with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge devices, such as camera, the cloud not only manages the user generate data but also devices generated data. This increment in the volume of outsourced data has raised two important issues in big data management for cloud storage servers, namely, optimal data storage and data security. In order to solve the former issue, cloud storage employs a deduplication technique to avoids storing duplicate data; and uses encryption to solve the later issue. However, both these issues are orthogonal in nature. Thanks to convergent encryption that addresses both the issues simultaneously. Nevertheless, the existing approaches relies on proxy servers and put all the trust on third party, which is vulnerable to single point failure. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight decentralized encrypted cloud storage architecture called, Yugula, which maintains file confidentiality, removes the centralized data deduplication and increases file integrity by using blockchain. In particular, we discuss two approaches for file confidentiality with data deduplication: one uses double hashing and the other symmetric encryption. In order to show the efficiency and usability, we implemented the proposed architecture and showed its results in terms of high transaction throughput requirement for IoT data management in cloud storage.",

        "Abstract": "China's economy is in a critical period of transformation and upgrading, and the financial industry has also entered a deep reform zone. It is necessary to improve financial services to better assist the development of SMEs. Difficult and expensive financing has always been a problem faced by SMEs in the development process. Supply chain finance provides important financial support for financing difficulties of SMEs. In the process of continuous development of industrial upgrading, the development model of supply chain finance has also become more diversified. It is necessary to improve the current operation mode of supply chain finance. Blockchain technology has been developing rapidly. Relying on its characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering, smart contracts, etc., the research of various \"blockchain +\" scenarios continues to bring forth new ideas, which can effectively solve the practical application of supply chain finance Existing risk issues. This paper studies the technical principles and characteristics of blockchain, analyzes the current situation of supply chain financial risk management and control, and discusses the use of blockchain technology in supply chain financial risk management and control.",

        "Title": "Performance optimisation Method of PBFT Consensus for Supply Chain Integration SVM",
        "Abstract": "The Hyperledge Fabric permissioned consortium chain based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), the interference of the dishonest node as the primary node to the consensus process caused the performance problems in the application of the supply chain. To solve this problem, a consensus performance optimisation method that integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM) and PBFT is proposed in this research. Firstly, SVM is used to evaluate the trust of consensus nodes in blockchain network. By selecting a consensus node with a high degree of trust as the primary node to reduce the possibility of dishonest nodes as the primary node. Then, introduce a dynamic adjustment credit incentive mechanism to the blockchain network by reducing the consensus trust of malicious nodes and inactive nodes in the blockchain, which will improve the security of the supply chain system. Finally, the experimental results show that, comparing with the existing methods, the consensus node trust evaluation and credit incentive mechanism have improved the throughput and latency of the supply chain blockchain application.",

        "Title": "Decentralized Content Vetting in Social Network with Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Online social network users suffer from rumors and misinformation. Most of these networks are centralized and controlled by a single entity. Such centralized entities may intervene to prevent the propagation of social media content that it considers as misinformation. However, such vetting entities may be biased and may selectively prevent misinformation. In this chapter, we propose a blockchain\u2010based decentralized content vetting for social network. We use Bitcoin as the underlying blockchain model, and we develop a unidirectional channel model to execute the vetting procedure. In this vetting procedure, all users get a chance to vote for and against a content. Content with sufficient positive votes is considered as the vetted content. We optimize the offline channel network topology to reduce computation overhead due to using blockchains. We prove the efficiency of the vetting procedure with experiments using simulations of content propagation in social network.",

        "Abstract": "Maintaining land records is a difficult task for countries with large area and population. Having a central database server is not a 100% safe alternative to paper-based traditional records as it is susceptible to cyber-attacks and frauds. This paper proposes an idea to solve this issue using blockchain. The proposed land records system is based on a hybrid blockchain network. The existing land records are put on the blockchain by the government. All land sales transactions are recorded on this hybrid blockchain. These transactions are mined (verified) by a miner which is run on government authorized peers or nodes. These records or transactions cannot be tampered with. The citizens can view their owned lands and corresponding transactions but cannot make changes to any data on the blockchain. Being based on hybrid blockchain, this system is benefitted by advantages of both the types of blockchain-public and private and is more secure and reliable than databases and paper records.",

        "Title": "TAIRA-BSC - Trusting AI in Recruitment Applications through Blockchain Smart Contracts",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology (BCT) are considered two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. BCT, although commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, has shown a tremendous impact among many other distributed applications domains. BCT characteristics, such as the distribution of data storage among independent nodes and the use of consensus algorithms offer immutability and transparency and remove the need for a central authority making BCT trustworthy. However, decision-makers and stakeholders currently lack the confidence to overcome uncertainty related to AI technology, which affects the acceptance of AI technology in wider application domains, such as the recruitment process. Furthermore, current research literature does not adequately investigate the role of trust as an integral part of an AI-based recruitment application. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate how emerging BCT and AI technologies can improve decision making and stakeholder trust in a job recruitment system that is traditionally focused on just human expert decision-making. In this paper we propose the design of a new solution for trusting AI in recruitment applications through the use of Blockchain Smart Contracts (TAIRA-BSC). TAIRA-BSC integrates Blockchain Smart Contracts (BSC) with the Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies in our AI Recruitment Model (AIRM) architecture. TAIRA-BSC improves transparency and interoperability in the recruitment process while protecting sensitive job candidate data and ensures data integrity delivery and traceability in the recruiting process through a verifiable decentralized ledger, i.e., the blockchain and associated smart contracts. The paper presents a discussion on the state-of-the-art of integrating AI with BCT focusing on how BCT can be used to bridge trust concerns with AI systems. We also present a conceptual architecture TAIRA-BSC proof of concept that is developed to serve as a foundation fo...",

        "Abstract": "Many threshold systems require some kind of secret sharing during their set-up phase. There has been several recent work in doing secret sharing in a distributed manner through the use of Blockchain so that one does not have to rely on trusted third parties nor strong assumptions about the communication medium. This paper continues this line of work and presents a new protocol for distributed key generation (DKG). We develop a new technique that leverages the mainchain of a popular blockchain platform like Bitcoin, together with a mixing service and a group signature scheme, to provide anonymity and traceability; we connect this to a sidechain, pegged to the mainchain, that brings a better scalability. We implemented the technique on the joint platform Bitcoin/RootStock and use CoinJoin/CoinShuffle as the mixing service. The evaluation section shows a decrease by 99 % in the execution cost of our protocol compared to the same implementation on a smart-contract-friendly blockchain such as Ethereum.",

        "Title": "Evaluation of the abstraction of optical topology models in blockchain-based data center interconnection",
        "Abstract": "Data center (DC) interconnection allows us to have optical transmissions between DCs directly connected to optical networks, avoiding the use of a packet-based infrastructure. Thanks to the use of next-generation pluggable coherent optics, it is possible to create connectivity services (CSs) across multiple optical transport domains. In this multi-domain CS scenario, cloud operators and transport operators have to work together in the most dynamic way possible. To do so, they need a common place (i.e., a market) where the transport operators may expose their available optical resources and the cloud operators request (e.g., rent) them to be used in order to create end-to-end (E2E) CSs between DCs. Having multiple transport operators exposing their resource information in a common place requires a set of common rules (i.e., how much of the topology to show) to create E2E CSs requested between cloud operators. This paper makes use of the blockchain technology to present a blockchain-based extension for the software-defined network (SDN) architecture to allow each optical transport operator domain to become a peer in a blockchain network. In there, each peer follows the same rules and shares the same exact level of topology information by using a specific abstraction model to map the optical domain resources. This paper uses a set of three different abstraction models to validate their behavior on a blockchain system when managing multiple domain resources and the deployment of CSs across these domains. To do so, an experimental comparison on how the different abstraction models affect the performance of the blockchain system is presented.",

        "Abstract": "The low performance of blockchains has been considered as one of the main challenges in deploying blockchains. This blockchain performance has been discussed and analyzed for further improvements, especially in wired blockchains. In wired blockchains, transactions, messages for consensus protocols (CPs), and new blocks are all transmitted through wired links. However, even though wireless blockchains have actively emerged in recent years, most of blockchain works are still focused on wired blockchains. Being different from wired blockchains, transactions, messages for CPs, and new blocks can face the characteristics of wireless communications, such as limited communication resources, path loss, and higher interference. This is highly influential on the performance of wireless blockchains, especially on CPs that play an important role in fault tolerance inside blockchains. In this paper, therefore, we discuss the impacts of communications on wireless blockchains. We then provide trade-offs and future challenges, which need to be newly considered for higher performance in wireless blockchains.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is an immutable append-only decentralized ledger that theoretically makes it an ideal data storage system. The nature of blockchain design ensures stored data is reliable, trustworthy, and transparent. However, the blockchain's full-replication feature makes it ineffective to store a large volume of data directly on-chain. This paper provides a systematic review and analysis of existing decentralized file systems. Our focus was on systems that can support large, high-frequency data writing while still providing swift and easy data retrieval for blockchain-based applications. The challenge, in our view, is to find ways to achieve those efficiency outcomes while still retaining the key decentralized features of blockchain design. With that in mind, we assessed the costs involved in using nine state-of-the-art decentralized file systems and we also considered their latency performance.",

        "Abstract": "As the COVID-19 continues to spread globally, more and more companies are transforming into remote online offices, leading to the expansion of electronic signatures. However, the existing electronic signatures platform has the problem of data-centered management. The system is subject to data loss, tampering, and leakage when an attack from outside or inside occurs. In response to the above problems, this paper designs an electronic signature solution and implements a prototype system based on the consortium blockchain. The solution divides the contract signing process into four states: contract upload, initiation signing, verification signing, and confirm signing. The signing process is mapped with the blockchain-linked data. Users initiate the signature transaction by signing the uploaded contract's hash. The sign state transition is triggered when the transaction is uploaded to the blockchain under the consensus mechanism and the smart contract control, which effectively ensures the integrity of the electronic contract and the non-repudiation of the electronic signature. Finally, the blockchain performance test shows that the system can be applied to the business scenario of contract signing.",

        "Abstract": "Medical data sharing is increasingly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare management. Mobility of patients, healthcare financing, and changing modes of care require that health data pass from the institutions that generate the data to others that need it to support healthcare delivery outcomes. These factors lead to challenges that render the sharing arrangement necessary but vulnerable to attack by malicious users. The conventional paradigms of sharing do not include techniques for data control after access permissions are granted. Thus, the data exchange leaves patients at the risk of privacy breaches and institutions are exposed to punitive measures when protected health information in their care is compromised. Blockchain technology presents mechanisms to secure patients' data using cryptographically secure techniques with game\u2010theoretic models of behavior control. This chapter focuses on three paradigms of data sharing and ends with an exposition on some exceptional cases where the application of blockchain in medical data sharing has valuable contributions.",

        "Title": "A Proxy Re-Encryption Approach to Secure Data Sharing in the Internet of Things Based on Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "The evolution of the Internet of Things has seen data sharing as one of its most useful applications in cloud computing. As eye-catching as this technology has been, data security remains one of the obstacles it faces since the wrongful use of data leads to several damages. In this article, we propose a proxy re-encryption approach to secure data sharing in cloud environments. Data owners can outsource their encrypted data to the cloud using identity-based encryption, while proxy re-encryption construction will grant legitimate users access to the data. With the Internet of Things devices being resource-constrained, an edge device acts as a proxy server to handle intensive computations. Also, we make use of the features of information-centric networking to deliver cached content in the proxy effectively, thus improving the quality of service and making good use of the network bandwidth. Further, our system model is based on blockchain, a disruptive technology that enables decentralization in data sharing. It mitigates the bottlenecks in centralized systems and achieves fine-grained access control to data. The security analysis and evaluation of our scheme show the promise of our approach in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and security.",

        "Abstract": "In recent decades, video surveillance systems have become an indispensable management tool for cities. Managers can grasp the information of the scene without visiting the scene. Through the surveillance system, the effect of management and supervision can be improved, and the probability of major accidents can be reduced. However, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, video surveillance systems will face challenges such as massive equipment access, massive data, insufficient bandwidth, vulnerable to attack, and real-time monitoring difficulties. Based on the analysis of the research and application status of video surveillance system, we propose a video surveillance system based on permissioned blockchains (BCs) and edge computing. The system uses permissioned BCs, edge computing, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technology and convolution neural networks (CNNs). The edge computing is used to achieve large-scale wireless sensor information acquisition and data processing. IPFS storage service is used to realize massive video data storage, and CNNs technology is used to realize real-time monitoring.",

Since most blockchain nodes retain copies of the ledger, the blockchain brings the benefits of decentralization while also bringing privacy leakage issues. With the continuous development of blockchain applications, how to protect the privacy data on the blockchain platform is a very worthwhile research question. This paper first divides each blockchain transaction data into two parts: sensitive data and basic data, and then encrypts and hides the sensitive data into the HEVC video to protect the privacy transaction data of the blockchain. The experimental results show that this HEVC video steganography algorithm can effectively increase the privacy data embedding capacity and get good visual quality.",

It is a legal process which collects, examines, analyzes and reports the evidence. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned and private blockchain structure which includes the present estimation of the element's property and the historical backdrop of transactions. In forensic department, every piece of evidence should be properly identified, collected, preserved, analyzed and finally admitted to the proper authority. But in reality assembling, evaluating, storing evidence is not secured enough. So in this paper, we are focused on creating a blockchain based medical forensic system using Hyperledger. The system can track any unauthorized access and modification by retrieving the Historian Record and Asset Registries and thus guarantees the impartiality of evidence, secrecy and validity of transactions.",

        "Abstract": "As the backbone of the smart grid, smart metering systems enable customers, as well as utility companies, to have access to real-time information on consumption patterns in electricity, gas, and water. From a technical standpoint, smart metering systems (1) reduce the need to verify electricity, gas, and water consumption services, (2) allow for efficient management of electricity, gas, and water consumption patterns, and (3) protect natural resources. Additionally, smart metering systems provide a number of important functions that should be performed manually, such as automatic and remote measurement of electricity, gas, and water consumption, connect or disconnect service, tampering detection, outage identification and isolation, and collecting, aggregating, and analyzing real-time information of the fundamental parameters associated with customers\u2019 services, i.e., voltage, current, etc. Besides, considering the number of customers, there are several limitations to accessing and sharing the data between utility companies and customers, and therefore, reliable and secure communication infrastructure is needed. To resolve such issues, a conceptual and technological Blockchain-based system is developed to securely share the real-time collected data from a set of various sensors for monitoring and control of electricity, gas, and water consumption, namely the multifunctional integrated smart metering system. The proposed system takes advantage of a decentralized structure, connectivity of the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, data privacy, and transparency and auditability. The proposed Blockchain-based smart metering system allows customers to securely monitor their actual electricity, gas, and water consumption for a specific period of time and review the full history of consumption. This leads to finding solutions to rationalize the consumption of electricity, gas, and water resources.",

Network slicing enables the consumers to deliver individualized and customized telecommunication services on the commonly shared infrastructure. Slice brokering is the dedicated service to facilitate the tenants and resource providers in slice allocation process. We proposed SFSBroker (Secured and Federated Slice Broker) to leverage the slice brokering process with the application of game theory. We formulated the optimal slice selection problem into the Stackelberg game model. The computational logic has been incorporated on smart contracts. Furthermore, the proposed architecture includes Security Service Blockchain (SSB) which has been integrated for Denial of Service (DoS) attack prevention. We implemented the end to end setup including tenant request to slice creation using Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, Katana slice manager, and OpenStack. In this demonstration, the system provisions to obtain hands-on experience on the end to end workflow of slice brokering process.",

Traditional IoT access control systems are centralized and do not include all the stakeholders in the access control decision making process. To fill this gap, we propose a permissioned blockchain based access control system for IoT where a different phase of access control like creating access policy and making the access control decision happens based on the consensus of all the stakeholders. To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.",

        "Abstract": "The actual route of blockchain virtual link may be different every time. The larger the network scale, the more nodes need to reach a consensus. The slower the progress of consensus, the lower the throughput. To solve this problem, this paper uses PSO execution algorithm to fuse SGslice and blockchain, and designs a block chain node information fusion mechanism algorithm based on 5g. The experimental results show that the fusion algorithm greatly improves the communication efficiency of each node of the blockchain, so that the blockchain can not affect the communication speed between nodes while increasing the number of nodes, so as to greatly improve the security of the blockchain and make it better applied in various scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "Consensus algorithms can be considered as the core of blockchain technology. Different algorithms provide various advantages and disadvantages to the platform, which can cause the variation in the aspects of scalability, reliability, security, and performance. Deploying a blockchain platform with a consensus algorithm that is not suitable for the situated scenario may lead to low efficiency, waste of energy, unfairness and more. As more businesses are trying to introduce blockchain into their system, there is a demand for selecting consensus algorithms that are suitable for a private chain. Most of the current consensus algorithms are Voting-based or PBFT-based. However, Voting-based algorithms may suffer much from leader-crash, while PBFT-based algorithms may experience network congestion when implemented in a huge network due to its broadcast-like confirmation steps. In this paper, we aim to propose a new type of consensus algorithm based solely on Random Number Generation, called Mosaic. The selection is not only due to its low computational cost compared to cryptographically proof-based algorithms, but also because of its acceptable unpredictability that makes the election fairer. In the evaluation, we demonstrate that Mosaic is more efficient than PBFT-based schemes in large-scale while also providing fault tolerance compared to Raft.",

        "Title": "Decentralized Lightweight Detection of Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin Clients",
        "Abstract": "Clients of permissionless blockchain systems, like Bitcoin, rely on an underlying peer-to-peer network to send and receive transactions. It is critical that a client is connected to at least one honest peer, as otherwise the client can be convinced to accept a maliciously forked view of the blockchain. In such an eclipse attack, the client is unable to reliably distinguish the canonical view of the blockchain from the view provided by the attacker. The consequences of this can be catastrophic if the client makes business decisions based on a distorted view of the blockchain transactions. In this paper, we investigate the design space and propose two approaches for Bitcoin clients to detect whether an eclipse attack against them is ongoing. Each approach chooses a different trade-off between average attack detection time and network load. The first scheme is based on the detection of suspicious block timestamps. The second scheme allows blockchain clients to utilize their natural connections to the Internet (i.e., standard web activity) to gossip about their blockchain views with other clients through contacted servers. Our proposals improve upon previously proposed eclipse attack countermeasures without introducing any dedicated infrastructure or changes to the Bitcoin protocol and network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the gossip-based schemes through real-world implementation. The results of our experiments indicate that the protocol incurs a negligible overhead, detects eclipse attacks rapidly with high probability, and is well-suited for practical deployment.",

        "Title": "Utilizing Parallelism in Smart Contracts on Decentralized Blockchains by Taming Application-Inherent Conflicts",
        "Abstract": "Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications. In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction exe-cution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and spe-cial commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we eval-uated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.",

        "Title": "A Solution to Data Accessibility Across Heterogeneous Blockchains",
        "Abstract": "Cross-heterogeneous blockchain interactions have been attracting much attention due to their application in depository blockchains mutual access and cross-blockchain identity authentication. Trusted access across heterogeneous chains is gradually becoming a hot challenge. In order to ensure cross-blockchain trusted access, the majority of the current works focus on on-chain notaries and the relay chain model. However, these methods have the following drawbacks: 1) notaries on the chain are more vulnerable to attacks due to their high degree of centralization, which causes off-chain users to lose their trust and thus exacerbates the off-chain trust crisis; 2) although the relay model involves multiple parties in maintenance and supervision and enjoys a more robust trust, the paticipatant nodes are relatively fixed, which impose a terrible dilemma that invalid nodes cannot participate in consensus formation in a timely manner, thus progressively disrupting the connectivity of the relay across heterogeneous chains and eventually reducing the rate of trusted mutual access. In this article, we propose a novel general framework for cross-heterogeneous blockchain communication based on a periodical committee rotation mechanism to support information exchange of diverse transactions across multiple heterogeneous blockchain systems. Connecting heterogeneous blockchains through committees has a more robust trust than the notary method. In order to eliminate the impact of downtime nodes in a timely manner, we periodically reorganize the committee and give priority to replacing downed nodes to ensure the reliability of the system. In addition, a message-oriented verification mechanism is designed to improve the rate of trusted intervisit across heterogeneous chains. We have built a prototype of the scheme and conducted simulation experiments on the current mainstream blockchain for message exchange across heterogeneous chains. The results show that our solution has a good perfo...",

        "Title": "Token-Based Sharing Control for IPFS",
        "Abstract": "Blockchains can now be used to distribute digital assets independent of specific organizations. One way to handle digital assets on a blockchain is through tokens. Tokens define chunks of data on a blockchain, allowing it to be distributed like virtual currency. However, storing all data related to digital assets in a token is difficult. Data is currently managed separately because storing a large amount of data in a blockchain can cause the ledger to grow large. When the management of data depends on a particular organization, the stability of the token's value depends on that particular organization. In this paper, we propose an organization-independent management method that combines a distributed content-addressable file system with a blockchain. Our proposed method places the data associated with the token and the access information to the token into the distributed content-addressable file system. As a result, the token associated with the data has the sharing control of the data stored in the distributed content-addressable file system, and a configuration independent of the specific contract is realized.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, healthcare analytics is considered as an important application of research topic in medical field. The patient data is the main concern to be noticed in healthcare analytics solutions. The privacy of data leads to securing the data with high quality of care and requires a best design methodology. In current scenario, many failed to provide security of data which stored in server accessible by third party. To improve the data security and privacy thereby reducing bandwidth and improving efficiency, a consortium method called Enhanced Proof of Work (E-PoW) consensus blockchain for IoT based healthcare monitoring system has been proposed.",

        "Title": "Multi-Batch Scheduling for Improving Performance of Hyperledger Fabric Based IoT Applications",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has been regarded as a paradigm that enables enterprises to deploy decentralized Internet of things (IoT) applications, which require security, mutual truthfulness, privacy, and data reliability. However, the adoption of blockchain technology on IoT applications has been limited due to the lack of blockchain's capability to process a huge amount of transaction requests from IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a new transaction processing mechanism, called Accelerator, which improves the performance of blockchain-based IoT applications in terms of transaction throughput and latency. Two key design ideas of Accelerator lie in: (i) independent modular structure that can be implemented without changing the incumbent blockchain network and (ii) adaptive multi-batch scheduling engine for robust performance. We first provide a mathematical analysis that is used to choose the parameters of Accelerator to maximize the performance. Moreover, we implement Accelerator on a decentralized blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and perform the extensive test using Hyperledger Caliper. We show that Accelerator achieves 8x transaction throughput improvement without sacrificing latency.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain specifications distributed ledger, traceability, immutability provide a secure high-speed voting system. Data stored on the blockchain cannot be traced back, edit or deleted due to which transparent and high-performance capabilities are inherent to the network. But as the information of the e-voting system increases storage space and processing cost also increases due to an increase in delay. This delay increases as the comparison of hash value with the existing hash value for uniqueness. Apart from the uniqueness of hash designer also required initial 8 bytes of hash to be zeros. In this paper, we propose the multiobjective genetic algorithm-based creation of a side-chain to enhance the scalability and performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system. We compare the storage cost and the processing cost of the state of the art models with the proposed model. our experiments yielded observations on the scalability and the performance of the blockchain-based e-voting system.",

        "Abstract": "This research focuses on designing a tracking system with blockchain technology to address the lack of transparency in supply chain flow in urban farming. Unlike the original distribution channel (farmers to consumers), this study proposes two distribution channels: a distribution channel with farmers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, and a distribution channel consisting of farmers, retailers, and consumers. A tracking system for suppliers and producers in an urban farming company is designed and implemented with peer-to-peer private blockchain technology using RFID, Raspberry Pi, Golang, and BitTorrent protocols. The study result helps to narrow the gap in theoretical and practical literature research on blockchain technology in supply chain management. It shows how blockchain technology supports tracking systems for suppliers and producers to minimize data falsification and maximize transparency between related parties for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) supply chains in Indonesia. Further study can be done to create a real-time system where researchers can develop a real-time peer-to-peer system.",

        "Abstract": "with the existence of the new revolution of software techniques, tampering with the videos became easier than ever. For retaining the integrity of the captured scenes, novel methods are required. Blockchain is now one of the most interesting integrity verification techniques. Blockchain provides trust among the participant nodes; \"users\" without the need of a trusted third party. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-based framework for integrity verification of videos. In the proposed framework, the scene is captured and hashed in its original state and the captured frame; \"video frame\" is stored as a reference frame. The hash value, frame name, and timestamp of the capturing time are stored in a CSV file. The genesis block of a permissioned blockchain is created with this data. Other frames are captured for the same scene every predefined period and hashed. If the new hash value is identical to the reference hash, then the new frame is deleted to preserve storage space, and the metadata of the frame is stored in the same CSV file. If the hash values are not identical, then the name of the frame is changed to the timestamp of the capturing time, the frame then is propagated to all participant nodes, an email is sent to a predefined mail to take the appropriate action, and finally, a new block will be created with the new metadata. The proposed system ensures the integrity of the captured videos, ease to use and robustness.",

Be it food, drug or luxury items, all kinds of industrial manufacturers and distributors are now seeking greater transparency in supply chain operations with a view to deter counterfeiting. This paper introduces a decentralized Blockchain based application system (DApp) with a view to identifying counterfeit products in the supply chain system. With the rapid rise of Blockchain technology, it has become known that data recorded within Blockchain is immutable and secure. Hence, the proposed project here uses this concept to handle the transfer of ownership of products. A consumer can verify the product distribution and ownership information scanning a Quick Response (QR) code generated by the DApp for each product linked to the Blockchain.",

However, with the rising popularity of this new paradigm, the concept of blockchain shifted greatly to the point where many systems marketed as \"blockchain\" without sharing the key components introduced by Bitcoin. It has therefore become quite challenging for system designers or decision-makers to achieve a sufficient understanding of different types of existing blockchains or to design and adopt the correct blockchain solution. To overcome this problem, we propose DCEA a holistic reference model for conceptualizing and closely examining blockchains and globally distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using a layer-wise framework that envisions all these systems as constructed of four layers: the data, consensus, execution and application layers.",

        "Abstract": "Development of large-scale and complex software systems requires multiple teams, including software development teams, domain experts, user representatives, and other project stakeholders, to work collaboratively to achieve software development goals. These teams rely on the use of agreed software development processes, knowledge management tools, and communication channels collaboratively in the software development project. Software testing is an important and complicated process due to reasons such as difficulties in achieving testing goals with the given time constraint, absence of efficient data sharing policies, vague testing acceptance criteria at various levels of testing, and lack of trusted coordination among the teams involved in software testing. The efficiency of the software testing relies on efficient, reliable, and trusted information sharing among these teams. Existing approaches to software testing for collaborative software development use centralized or decentralize tools for software testing, knowledge management, and communication channels. Existing approaches have the limitations of centralized authority, a single point of failure/compromise, lack of automatic requirement compliance checking and transparency in information sharing, and lack of unified data sharing policy, and reliable knowledge management repositories for sharing and storing past software testing artifacts and data. In this paper, a software testing approach for collaborative software development using private blockchain is presented, and the desirable properties of private blockchain, such as distributed data management, tamper-resistance, auditability and automatic requirement compliance checking, are incorporated to greatly improve the quality of software testing for collaborative software development.",

        "Title": "Timing of blockchain adoption in a supply chain with competing manufacturers",
        "Abstract": "Recent improvements in consumers' awareness of product traceability have revealed the disadvantages of traditional supply chain traceability systems. Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products. The results of this study provide guidance for supply chain members\u2019 market practices.",

        "Title": "Sustainable development of green reverse logistics based on blockchain",
        "Abstract": "With the continuous convenience of life, logistics has become an indispensable existence in life. Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a \u201cdouble chain\u201d structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",

        "Abstract": "The continuous strengthening of the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems is vital due to the increasing number of interconnected devices and the volume of sensitive data shared. Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model\u2019s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization\u2019s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.",

        "Abstract": "Digital collection and maintenance of evidence corresponding to an accident is of utmost relevance as vehicles become connected and part of Internet of things ecosystem. A conceptual evidence management framework is proposed examining the future of accident investigation forensics in the era of connected vehicles. The framework discusses how evidence generated from vehicles involved in incident along with supporting evidence from nearby vehicles CCTVs and road users can be collected and managed over blockchain using smart contracts in a vehicle to everything connected environment. The management of evidence over blockchain serves as an immutable and auditable means to investigate and settle cases post an accident among the stakeholders. Dynamic access control over evidence data and reports based on location of incident and vehicle involved is implemented with the help of smart contracts. The cost of deploying and carrying out transactions using the smart contracts is evaluated over both public and private Ethereum blockchain. Mechanism and cost involved in storing evidence on chain versus off chain using Inter Planetary File System in most optimised manner saving memory and execution cost is compared and presented. The smart contract codes are deployed on Rinkeby test network and can be accessed using address mentioned.",

        "Title": "Security and QoS issues in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks: A tutorial",
        "Abstract": "The blockchain-enabled smart logistics market is expected to grow worth USD 1620 billion and at a compound annual growth rate of 62.4%. Smart logistics ensures intelligence infrastructure, logistics automation, real-time analysis of supply chain data synchronization of the logistics process, cost transparency, unbroken shipment tracking all the way down to the transportation route, etc. In the smart logistics domain, significant advancement and growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are evident. However, the connectivity of IoT systems, including Tactile Internet, without proper safeguards creates vulnerabilities that can still be deliberately or inadvertently cause disruption. In view of this, we primarily notice two key issues. Firstly, the logistics domain can be compromised by a variety of natural or man-made activities, which eventually affect the overall network security. Secondly, there are thousands of entities in the supply chain network that use extensive machine-learning algorithms in many scenarios, and they require high-power computational resources. From these two challenges, we note that the first concern can be addressed by adding blockchain to IoT logistic networks. The second issue can be addressed using 6G. This will support 1-\u03bcs latency communications, support seamless computing at the edges of networks, and autonomously predict the best optimal location for edge computing. Motivated by this, we have highlighted motivational examples to show the necessity to integrate 6G and blockchain in smart logistic networks. Then, we have proposed a 6G and blockchain-enabled smart logistic high-level framework. We have presented the key intrinsic issues of this framework mainly from the security and resource management context. In this paper, recent state-of-the-art advances in blockchain enabled next-generation smart logistic networks are analyzed. We have also examined why 6G and not 5G would be compatible with the smart network. We have introduced five different use cases of blockchain technology in smart logistics. Later, this paper discusses some important concerns that blockchain in smart logistics might face. We have also provided potential solutions to tackle these concerns.",

In the field of smart grids, a plethora of proposals have emerged to utilize blockchain for augmenting intelligent energy management, energy trading, security and privacy protection, microgrid management, and energy vehicles. Compared with traditional centralized approaches, blockchain-based solutions are able to exploit the advantages of blockchain to realize better functionality in smart grids. However, the blockchain technology itself has its disadvantages in low processing throughput and weak privacy protection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to study how to integrate blockchain with smart grids in a more effective way so that the advantages of blockchain can be maximized and its disadvantages can be avoided.",

        "Abstract": "The 5G mobile Internet facilitates contents generation for online communities and platforms through human-to-human collaboration. Wikipedia, a well-known online community, uses wiki technology to build an encyclopedia through collective intelligence and collaboration. Mainstream wiki systems adopt a centralized implementation, and while existing studies have optimized the efficiency of the wiki systems' centralized implementation, these systems still suffer from a lot of problems, for example, opacity and distrust. Over the years, blockchain has brought a flurry of fervour and decentralization to the system architecture, meanwhile gives users a sense of trust and participation. Thus, an innovative blockchain-enabled wiki framework called DecWiki is proposed to build one transparent, truthful, collaborative and autonomous encyclopedia. After several participatory design iterations, we present DecWiki's detailed architecture and its implementation in the form of smart contract and use the interplanetary file system to complement the big data storage. Meanwhile, we use the trusted execution environment to secure sensitive information in the wireless scenario. Finally, the system overhead and the acceptance of the prototype are evaluated. Extensive experiments present its significant performance.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the online platform has been used by many educational institutions, to conduct tests, especially for secondary to tertiary level students. The most popular online test program is run by providing a user id and password to the candidates, and subsequently, they log in to the given web page to answer the questions. However, this system has a lot of bugs, the password can be misused followed by cheating in the test. This shows the importance of a secure system being implemented to avoid such a problem. This paper presents a blockchain framework that secures the online examination system. The proposed framework has been used to secure a data management system that connects to existing educational data. Institutions can simply compile their data history without requiring a copy from the central servers. The proposed blockchain framework improves data security and removes any potential cheating between users or third-party institutions that access applications and services. In this regard, this study provides a secured framework for conducting and evaluating subject tests to ensure consistency between student and server, and secure delivery of questionnaire from the server.",

        "Title": "Research on identity authentication system of Internet of Things based on blockchain technology",
        "Abstract": "With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications, a large amount of data is generated regularly. If this information is used by malicious attackers, it will be a great disaster for the relevant users. In this regard, this article focuses on the user\u2019s identity privacy issues involved in the IoT. By protecting the user\u2019s identity privacy, the attacker cannot associate the obtained data with the user\u2019s real identity, and so achieve the purpose of protecting the user. This article uses the features of blockchain that cannot be tampered with nor forged to strengthen the reliability of the system. The proposed scheme saves the transaction information of user information through the Hyperledger and uses the ring signature method to obscure the real identity. A key generator is used to generate system public parameters and ring membership information required for signature. Users can use this information to hide their identity in a ring group of n users so that other users can only guess the true identity of the user with a probability of 1/n. Additionally, the method of aggregated signature is used to shorten the time and space required for k signature verification to 1/k, which greatly improves the efficiency. Finally, this article also uses an accountability mechanism to punish some attackers who attempt to waste system resources by revealing the real identity of the attacker and refusing to serve him. In this paper, GO language is used to write chain code to realize the proposed algorithm, and a prototype system is built through HyperLeger Fabric blockchain network, and the prototype system is verified by experiment. The correctness and efficiency of the above scheme are also proved through theoretical analysis and experiments.",

        "Abstract": "In view of the problem of privacy leakage caused by the centralized location privacy protection method in mobile crowd sensing, a privacy protection method based on blockchain smart contract was proposed. Firstly, the trusted distributed environment blockchain is adopted to replace the third-party server. In order to avoid the leakage of personal information, users register an anonymous identity on the blockchain. In addition, in order to solve the problem of user\u2019s location privacy leakage caused by mutual deceiving behavior among users in distributed structure, a dummy location algorithm based on two-attribute decision is designed on smart contract. In this algorithm, the distance between each location and the user location and the historical query probability of each location are obtained by calculating the peripheral location. Then, different thresholds are set for each location and a cyclic filtering is carried out. As a result, an anonymous set is obtained that effectively protects the user\u2019s location. Finally, the simulation experiment proves that the method can not only improve the efficiency of protecting user\u2019s location privacy, but also has lower time and computation overhead.",

The special structure of WSN brings both convenience and vulnerability. For example, a malicious participant can launch attacks by capturing a physical device. Therefore, node authentication that can resist malicious attacks is very important to network security. Recently, blockchain technology has shown the potential to enhance the security of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-empowered Authentication Scheme (BAS) for WSN. In our scheme, all nodes are managed by utilizing the identity information stored on the blockchain. Besides, the simulation experiment about worm detection is executed on BAS, and the security is evaluated from detection and infection rate. The experiment results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively inhibit the spread and infection of worms in the network.",

To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based crowdsensing model named\nwith a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed\noutperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.",

Blockchain has emerged as a promising technology to address most of the security issues, however, it is challenging to find an appropriate and trusted blockchain-based consensus protocol for crowdsourcing services. This work proposes a novel Trust-based Blockchain Crowdsourcing consensus protocol that selects a leader and validators based on various trust factors. The proposed protocol addresses a major issue of ensuring correctness associated with the safety and security-critical systems which has a vital importance because failure of such systems may lead to adverse consequences. Mainly it is focused on persistence and liveness properties preventing invalid block insertion and consensus delay attacks. Model checking technique is utilized because of its effectiveness and automatic nature to perform formal verification. The proposed protocol is specified using Communicating Sequential Programs, and the persistence and liveness properties are specified through Linear Temporal Logic. The model verification is performed by giving the formal model and the properties as input to the Process Analysis Toolkit which checks for the satisfaction or violation of the properties.",

        "Title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for energy-aware task offloading in join SDN-Blockchain 5G massive IoT edge network",
        "Abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge allows cloud computing services for topology and location-sensitive distributed computing. As an immediate benefit, it improves network reliability and latency by enabling data access and processing rapidly and efficiently near IoT devices. However, it comes with several issues stemming from the complexity, the security, the energy consumption, and the instability due to the decentralization of service localization. Furthermore, the multi-resource allocation and task scheduling make this task the furthest from being straightforward. Blockchain has been envisioned to enforce trustworthiness in diverse IoT environments. However, high latency and high energy costs are incurred to process IoT transactions. This paper introduces a novel Blockchain-based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to enable energy-aware task scheduling and offloading in an Software Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IoT network. The Asynchronous Actor\u2013Critic Agent (A3C) DRL-based policy achieves efficient task scheduling and offloading. The latter is in symbiosis with Proof-of-Authority Blockchain consensus to validate IoT transactions and blocks. By doing so, we improve reliability and low latency and achieve energy efficiency for SDN-enabled IoT networks. The A3C policy combined with the Blockchain is proved theoretically. Carried out experiments put forth that our approach offers 50% better energy efficiency, which outperforms traditional consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work and PBFT, in terms of throughput and network latency and offers better scheduling performance.",

        "Abstract": "The construction of smart grid has triggered comprehensive changes in power equipment. At the same time, massive data are waiting to be screened, analyzed and processed. However, there are many data sources and complex data structure in smart grid, and smart grid requires higher security, reliability, traceability, non-repudiation and real-time performance of data processing, which poses unprecedented challenges to the traditional data management. Blockchain technology has the advantages of decentralization, autonomy, leakage prevention and openness. It can match the demands of power data management in terms of operation mode, security protection, complement power data, and better meet the security and credibility requirements of energy Internet. Therefore, this paper designs the smart grid data management system based on blockchain, and constructs the system security evaluation model by using AHP and expert consultation method. Firstly, the characteristics of smart grid big data and blockchain technology are analyzed; Then the technical architecture of data management system is designed by using alliance chain, and the technical architecture is analyzed in detail; Finally, the index factors affecting system security are combed, and the system security evaluation model is constructed by AHP. Distributed storage, asymmetric encryption, consensus mechanism, and other technologies of blockchain technology can well solve the problems of power grid data storage and application, and better ensure the security of smart grid data.",

However, in the presence of subjective information that does not have a digital footprint, blockchain application is a grey area. This is due to the difficulty in confirming the authenticity or legitimacy of information before achieving consensus on it using existing mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Stake (PoS). In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we propose the Proof by Earnestness (PoE) consensus mechanism that determines the subjective information\u2019s truthfulness before further processing and formalising in blockchains. We consider supply chain risk management (SCRM) as our application area due to the vast amount of available subjective information.",

        "Abstract": "The healthcare business can benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of data management and transfer. Patient health data can be acquired locally from devices that can be used to make real-time decisions based on the data. For many years, several hospitals have deployed IoT in their patient rooms and their body parts. IoT devices could be vulnerable to hacking due to a lack of authentication and encryption policies, posing serious hazards to consumers. As a result, blockchain is useful for securing and proving transactions in the IoT. As a result, it is proposed that the problem be solved using Fog Computing (FGC), Edge Computing, and blockchain. Based on FGC technology, models of analysis, and a signature-encryption algorithm (SE), a three-tiered architecture is employed for the identification, verification, and identification of healthcare IoT devices. The generated findings are used to assess the suggested innovative SE algorithm. We discovered that FGC-based blockchain performed better for detecting malicious nodes in terms of packet error rate, reliability, and throughput when compared to cloud settings and other environments.",

Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users\u2019 privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.",

        "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing is a task assignment technology that has emerged in recent years, enabling companies to reduce costs and increase work efficiency. Most of the current crowdsourcing systems (BCSs) built on blockchain focus on solving privacy issues and use rigorous proof protocols for task and solution security. Such systems cannot be directly applied in mobile environments because it would lead to excessive computational overhead for the endpoint. To achieve confidentiality of crowdsourcing tasks during transmission while reducing the energy consumption of mobile devices and optimizing task assignment results, in this paper, we develop a blockchain-based crowdsourcing model. We first build a model structure consisting of basic components, such as users, smart contracts, and blockchain, and design contracts to implement various crowdsourcing operations, such as registering, publishing tasks, and acquiring solutions. Unlike before, the ciphertext of the task and the encrypted secret key are embedded into the contract. This, together with the three operations we designed for users to interact with the smart contracts, can effectively protect the crowdsourcing data from being stolen while using the address anonymity of Ethereum to ensure the privacy of users. During task assignment, we use the DBSCAN algorithm to delineate each valid service area and implement the established multiobjective planning model within each area to achieve as many benefit goals as possible in the best way. Finally, we implement our prototype on the Ethereum test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that the cost overhead of the designed model is acceptable to mobile users, and the security analysis establishes the confidentiality of the designed operations.",

The aid of technologies in smart cities is envisioned to be the key initiative to mitigate these challenges. However, the technologies exposure imposes challenging issues for the traditional centralized data dissemination schemes in smart cities. Consequently, smart city is undergoing a transition to a decentralized system through the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper presents an extensive survey of blockchain applicability for data dissemination in smart cities. We focus on the components of smart: transportation, healthcare, education, energy and building in smart cities and analyze state-of-the-art work on the integration of these components with blockchain. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of existing literature and evaluate the performance efficiency and the extent of security and privacy achieved. The analysis leads to our new design of a secure smart city data dissemination framework using blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive abstraction in the literature that can be utilized for the designation of future blockchain-smart cities data dissemination schemes with the inclusion of participating entities. Finally, we present open research issues and challenges and discuss future research directions.",

Fortunately, we have found the vaccine, in fact, a good number of them. However, managing the testing and vaccination process of the total population is a mammoth job. However, there are always delays or data silo problems in multi-organizational work. Therefore, streamlining this process is vital to improve efficiency and save more lives. Because of its effective data sharing mechanism among different entities with a number of security features, blockchain can be an effective tool for different applications in the health sector. Furthermore, blockchain provides a distributed system along with greater privacy, transparency, and authenticity. In this article, we have presented a blockchain-based system that seamlessly integrates testing and vaccination systems, allowing the system to be transparent. The instant verification of any tamper-proof COVID-19 test result has been developed, which will serve as \u201cTest Certificates\u201d. A transparent and efficient vaccination system has also been exhibited and implemented as the \u201cDigital Vaccine Passport\u201d (DVP) system. The infection rate-based prioritization will ensure a transparent and fair vaccination process as well as tackle the distribution issue of the limited amount of vaccine. The comparative review with other existing works is also discussed, highlighting a clear difference from the existing works. Our proposed system is distinctive on the basis of prioritization of vaccines and seamless integration of test certificates and vaccine passports, which will aid in controlling the pandemic situation. This system will also be handy in the case of tackling any future pandemics initially.",

        "Abstract": "Applying blockchain technology to the Internet of Things (IoT) provides several advantages when compared to conventional systems, including improving the security by ensuring data integrity and accountability while enabling reliable control over many devices. However, integrating blockchain into IoT systems presents some challenges. A main challenges is designing a consensus protocol that is suitable for the IoT systems, where some devices may lack adequate resources, such as computation power. This paper introduces a novel consensus protocol called honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) via scalable work. HDPoA is based on proof of authority (PoA) and proof of work (PoW), with the integration of PoW, HDPoA is able to realize the security advantages provided by PoW. This is achieved by utilizing the IoT devices\u2019 collective computation power to mine and generate a new block.",

        "Abstract": "In vehicle ad-hoc networks, the progression of wireless communication technology to 6G, overcomes storage, processing, privacy, and power limits to create an efficient and intelligent next generation transportation system. Vehicular ad hoc network may now offer remarkable availability, reliability, and throughput using 6G technology. However, the VANET system\u2019s data should be protected. This paper proposes an effective batch authentication and key exchange technique to avoid contact with hostile vehicle users. Moreover, three types of systems are proposed: PKI, ID-based, and MAC-based. The neuro-fuzzy inference technique was used to predict VANET security ratings. The Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain model is used to secure data transit. Additionally, this research examined the work from a blockchain perspective combined with MEC. There are 3 level to comprise the architecture: perception, edge computing, and services. Throughout the blockchain transmission process, the first layer make certain the security of VANET data. The perception layer makes use of edge computing and cloud services on the edge. The service layer protects data by using both traditional cloud storage and blockchain technology. The lowest layer of the system architecture is dedicated to the throughput and quality of service requirements of MEC users. The primary challenge is achieving consensus across blockchain nodes while maintaining the MEC system\u2019s and blockchain\u2019s performance. To simulate the joint optimization problem, a Markov decision process with reward function is utilized. The simulation results are conferred to illustrate the validity of study assertions.",

IoT systems deal with high volumes of data. This data can be particularly sensitive, as it may include health, financial, location, and other personal information. Therefore, fine-grained security management in IoT demands effective access control. Several proposals discuss access control for the IoT. However, a limited focus is given to the emerging blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. In this paper, we review the recent trends and critical needs for blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. We identify several important aspects of blockchain, including decentralised control, secure storage and sharing information in a trustless manner for IoT access control, including their benefits and limitations. Finally, we note some future research directions on converging blockchain in IoT access control efficiently and effectively.",

        "Title": "A blockchain-adaptive contractual approach for multi-contracting organizational entities",
        "Abstract": "Every organization relies on a designed contract to manage the rules that guide and coordinate the activities within each organization. However, traditional and contracts have many challenges. This has created the need for automated digital contracts, which are largely used within organizations. Although these contracts provide their own sets of advantages, they still have a single point of failure and still rely on trusted parties that cannot enforce rules. This has caused the introduction of blockchain smart contracts to help organizations collaborate in a decentralized manner. However, most contracting approaches are still influenced by traditional contracting schemes and cannot leverage the blockchain\u2019s features. This has made contracts designed over the blockchain network inefficient and difficult to manage. Existing contractual approaches also do not account for the full advantages of blockchain smart contracts due to a lack of focus in this area. The blockchain and its contracting mechanism are unique, and thus, a unique perspective must be brought in designing a contracting scheme that works efficiently with the blockchain and its inherent smart contracts. In this work, we develop a unique contractual approach that is adaptive to the blockchain and leverages its features in ensuring an efficient contracting scheme that is able to solve the major operations within organizations. We introduce a novel concept of contracting among blockchain networks using existing contract theory concepts to understand better how participants can work together across multiple organizations. We create a novel multi-contracting scheme for multiple parties to collaborate and work together efficiently between multiple organizations, ensuring the completion of projects and contract solidification. We develop a complex interlinked system of contracts to make contacts among multiple organizations easily traceable and manageable. We enhance this with a unique contract consolidation scheme to avoid redundancy. We utilize our proposed scheme to develop a uniquely transparent and fair workflow within organizations such as recruitment and employment leveraging blockchain-based oracle nodes. We extend this work to outsourced and sub-outsourced projects on the blockchain where an arbitration scheme is developed in multi-arbitration and multi-contracting scenarios. We also consider in our case in ex-facto situations. We tested our proposed blockchain-based idea over existing blockchain networks. Our results prove the feasibility and efficiency of our proposed idea.",

The blockchain announcements have led to a significantly positive increase in the value of listed firms since blockchain technology was valued in China. We find that high-tech firms with more technological attributes and reserves could be seen as more credible and trigger more significant stock returns than non-high-tech firms. In addition, state-owned high-tech firms with normal financial status and voluntary disclosure would augment such signaling credibility. In general, the results support that corporate announcements' signaling credibility is vital for market reaction.",

        "Abstract": "Currently, the global spread of COVID-19 is taking a heavy toll on the lives of the global population. There is an urgent need to improve and strengthen the coordination of vaccine supply chains in response to this severe pandemic. In this study, we consider a vaccine supply chain based on a combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies and model the supply chain as a two-player dynamic game with inventory level as the dynamic equation of the system. The study focuses on the applicability and effectiveness of the two technologies in the vaccine supply chain and provides management insights. The impact of the application of the technologies on environmental performance is also considered in the model. We also examine factors such as the number of people vaccinated, positive and side effects of vaccines, vaccine decay rate, revenue-sharing/cost-sharing ratio, and commission ratio. The results are as follows: the correlation between the difficulty in obtaining certified vaccines and the profit of a vaccine manufacturer is not monotonous; the vaccine manufacturer is more sensitive to changes in the vaccine attenuation rate. The study\u2019s major conclusions are as follows: First, the vaccine supply chain should estimate the level of consumers\u2019 difficulty in obtaining a certified vaccine source and the magnitude of the production planning and demand forecasting error terms before adopting the two technologies. Second, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is meaningful in the vaccine supply chain when the error terms satisfy a particular interval condition.",

It can better facilitate the seamless operation and supervision of port cold chain logistics and can meet the massive business demand for cold chain imports and the surging demand for pandemic prevention and control. However, it is a challenging task to incentivize cold chain enterprises in the maritime industry to adopt blockchain technology and actively participate in information sharing platform. Using evolutionary game theory, through an analysis of evolutionary stability strategies, this paper explores the evolutionary path of port cold chain logistics enterprises that participate in information sharing. An incentive mechanism based on blockchain smart contract is designed to encourage cold chain logistics enterprises to actively participate in information sharing within chains. Smart contracts can continuously encourage enterprises to participate in information sharing by timely adjusting the incentive participation costs of participating enterprises.",

        "Abstract": "Since the development of smart healthcare services, different solutions have been developed in the field of healthcare to increase the life expectancy of the patient by reducing the cost of healthcare. Digital Twin (DT) is considered one of the most promising technologies and a game changer in the field of healthcare. DT is generating a virtual imitation of a physical object that mimics the status of an event by changing the information in real time. In this article, a smart context-aware physical activity monitoring framework is developed by combining different advanced techniques such as IoT, DT, FoT, CoT, and Blockchain to maintain the sensitiveness of the healthcare domain. In the proposed study, the physical movements of an elder are analyzed by utilizing the sequential data processing capability of deep learning to detect irregular physical events. In addition, the proposed framework can keep the data of an individual secured by applying progressed security highlights of blockchain. The proposed solution effectively analyzed an irregular event of an individual with considerable accuracy in real time. The calculated outcomes have shown the effectiveness of DT with smart healthcare solutions that would help to develop effective medical services by bringing patients and medical care experts together. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed solution is measured with respect to irregular event recognition, model training and testing, rate of latency, and data processing cost. In this manner, a case study defines the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in the smart healthcare industry.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies introduced in Bitcoin, which engaged great attention from the industry and academia and determined a rapid growth of other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). In the complex architecture of a DLT system, a consensus protocol plays a key role by ensuring that all participants agree on the data integrity without any central authority. A wide range of consensus protocols have been designed with different concepts and properties (e.g., lower energy consumption, better scalability, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.). The key requirements for consensus protocols passing from one blockchain system to another often differ significantly, and there is no one-fit-all protocol. Therefore, selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential, but at the same time a challenging step, as decision-makers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements. This paper introduces a framework for selecting the most suitable consensus protocols depending on the identified criteria, priorities, and other requirements by incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. We demonstrate its potential by identifying the preferable consensuses for the three most common types of existing blockchain systems and on an actual application for bike renting. Moreover, the collected data and tools are freely available, ensuring full replicability, reusability, and further development.",

        "Abstract": "A smart home system composed of numerous smart devices has benefited people\u2019s life due to the feature of convenience. With the development of smart home technology, huge amounts of data stored on external servers flow between different smart devices, and the integrity of these data is of great importance to the security of smart home systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data integrity verification scheme that supports efficient dynamic operations for a smart home system. In the verification scheme, we utilize the home gateway (HG) to aggregate all the data information and design a data structure that can be efficiently and dynamically operated to store the tag information of the data, which can reduce the local storage pressure in smart home systems. Moreover, homomorphic verifiable tags are used to formulate verification strategies and record the interactions between HG, cloud service providers (CSP), and third-party auditor (TPA) on the blockchain to make the verification service traceable and useful. Then, the theoretical analysis and experiments prove that the scheme is effective and cost-acceptable in smart home systems.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) have accelerated e-commerce growth and empowered online businesses to create value even in a globally competitive environment. The goal of this study is to develop a framework for the virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) that is based on novel blockchain and IoT technologies, as well as the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used. The obtained results and performed sensitivity analysis are used to make some implications for business organisations and government administrators to create some important policies in favour of the environment, end-users, and the development of the organisation along with the nation.",

        "Abstract": "The cloud-aided sharing of e-healthcare data has great positive significance for research. However, due to the privacy consideration, these data are usually encrypted before uploading to the cloud server which impedes data sharing between different medical institutions. Conditional proxy re-encryption (CPRE) allows the proxy to converse ciphertext, especially by specifying a condition embed in the re-encryption key to achieve fine-grained access control over the ciphertext. Unfortunately, existing CPRE schemes cannot ensure the privacy of the condition, which may contain some sensitive private information. Furthermore, a malicious proxy server may return part of the results and even false data to save its computation or bandwidth. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based condition invisible proxy re-encryption scheme for the e-healthcare system. The proposed scheme guarantees the confidentiality of the data by hiding the condition in the re-encryption key so that the proxy cannot learn anything about the condition. Moreover, the ciphertext-searching algorithm is leveraged by executing the smart contract in the blockchain which ensures the results are correct and complete. Finally, experiment results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme in applications.",

        "Abstract": "This paper explores and demonstrates the innovation potential of blockchain and smart contracts for supply chain finance (SCF) based on cross-border beef supply chains from Australia to China. Our study adopts mechanism design and design-driven activities, and specifically employs the Agents Events Data (AED) process mapping method, which is a hybrid approach that combines Business Process Redesign (BPR) and the Resources Events Assets (REA) accounting model. The AED method consists of three sequential stages: (1) map supply chain's present state or condition; (2) introduce blockchain and smart contracts to improve supply chain processes and \u201ctraditional\u201d SCF models; and (3) evaluate the technology and innovation impact and create new models for SCF innovation. This study identified examples of how financial risks can be mitigated or reduced with blockchain and smart contracts; and, where the credit financing itself could be fundamentally transformed. Based on this analysis, the paper's contribution is twofold: First, it proposes the group buying business model as a basis of whole-of-supply-chain finance promising new areas for SCF models that can reduce financial cost and improve cash flow performance due to greater buyer-led financing certainty and the direct involvement of buy-side demand for supply-side improvements. Second, the study demonstrates the utility of the AED process mapping as a holistic framework with fine granular levels for future empirical and fieldwork and opens up new avenues for research.",

        "Abstract": "Cryptocurrency blockchain data encounter a class-imbalance problem due to only a few known labels of illicit or fraudulent activities in the blockchain network. For this purpose, we seek to compare various resampling methods applied to two highly imbalanced datasets derived from the blockchain of Bitcoin and Ethereum after further dimensionality reductions, which is different from previous studies on these datasets. Firstly, we study the performance of various classical supervised learning methods to classify illicit transactions or accounts on Bitcoin or Ethereum datasets, respectively. Consequently, we apply various resampling techniques to these datasets using the best performing learning algorithm on each of these datasets. Subsequently, we study the feature importance of the given models, wherein the resampled datasets directly influenced on the explainability of the model. Our main finding is that undersampling using the edited nearest-neighbour technique has attained an accuracy of more than 99% on the given datasets by removing the noisy data points from the whole dataset. Moreover, the best-performing learning algorithms have shown superior performance after feature reduction on these datasets in comparison to their original studies. The matchless contribution lies in discussing the effect of the data resampling on feature importance which is interconnected with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Immunization has become essential for prevention of infectious diseases during pandemic situations across the globe, and unsafe vaccines are seriously affecting public health and economy of countries. However, issues such as falsified or substandard and expired vaccines are still exist due to complex global supply chains and the fact that present vaccine management systems are under the control of different entities in the vaccine supply chain. Therefore, the requirement to develop the Cyber Physical ecosystem that is more resilient, responsive and having smart track and trace is urgently required. To achieve these objectives, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) based vaccine supply chain is proposed in this work. The proposed system takes advantages of blockchain database to store the generated data through interactions among stakeholders and from IoT devices in vaccine supply chain. The proposed system is implemented on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain framework through which the proposed system achieves resiliency, track and trace of vaccine circulation. The performance evaluations are obtained by testing a HLF with smart contracts. The evaluation is further driven by clients via Hyperledger Caliper, which is a bench mark tool used to measure the performance of blockchain solutions developed on Hyperledger. The results exhibit that the proposed system outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of throughput and latency etc.",

        "Abstract": "Recently, there has been significant growth in the consumption of the most widely diversified Internet of Things (IoT) technological knowledge, and devices, which has resulted in an impact on not only electrical items and the agricultural and food industries (Agri-Food) supply chain networks. This has sparked intense curiosity about the development of information sharing that is reliable, traceable, and transparent, and also increased significant research and advancement efforts. Existing IoT-based trace & authenticity methods for agri-food distribution networks are constructed on top of centralized architectures, which creates the potential for significant issues such as data security, manipulation, and standard points of weakness. A creative and scraping methodological approach to implementing decentralized trust-free networks is represented by blockchain technologies, the decentralized blockchain technologies that underpin cryptocurrencies. The fault tolerance, data integrity, visibility, and complete tracing of saved transactional data, along with cohesive digital information of property resources and independent transactions implementations, are in fact features built into this digitalization. This study introduces Agri-BlockIoT, a completely decentralized blockchain-based traceable platform for managing a global agro-food distribution network that can seamlessly connect IoT systems that produce and consume digital information all along the distribution chain. We implemented a use caseto achieve transparency and traceability. Lastly, we analyzed and contrasted the implementations' capability in terms of delay, CPU, or network utilization.",

        "Abstract": "This study aims to investigate blockchain technology for agricultural supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Benefits and solutions are identified for the smooth conduction of agricultural supply chains during COVID-19 using blockchain. This study uses interviews with agricultural companies operating in Pakistan. The findings discover the seven most commonly shared benefits of applying blockchain technology, four major challenges, and promising solutions. About 100% of the respondents mentioned blockchain as a solution for tracking the shipment during COVID-19, data retrieval and data management, product and transaction frauds, and an Inflexible international supply chain. Roughly 75% of the respondents mentioned the challenge of lack of data retrieval and data management and the Inflexible international supply chain in COVID-19 besides their solutions. This study can expand existing knowledge related to agricultural supply chains. The experiences shared in this study can serve as lessons for practitioners to adopt the blockchain technology for performing agricultural supply chain during pandemic situations such as COVID-19.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is impacting several industries, including the creative industries and those operating in the Internet of Things (IoT). Lately, researchers' attention has been devoted to the application of blockchain in the recorded music industry. However, thus far, no research has investigated the use of such technology in the Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT). The IoMusT is a new area emerging in industry and academy as an extension of the IoT to the musical domain. The IoMusT itself, as the IoT, is a distributed network of musical things, which are objects augmented with information and communication technologies serving a musical purpose. The IoMusT vision requires, above all, IoT features such as decentralization, seamless authentication, transparency, data integrity and privacy, and self-maintenance, as well as the musical domain features such as efficient handling of copyrights and speed of royalties payment. Such features can be brought by blockchain. In this paper, we investigate the integration of blockchain technology with the IoMusT, and we name such synthesis \u201cBlockchain-based IoMusT\u201d. We present a vision for this new paradigm in terms of the novel opportunities that are enabled, and we propose a set of application scenarios enabled by technological integration. Finally, we outline the open research directions in this promising area.",

        "Abstract": "The complexity and diversity of socio-economic environments call for a more nuanced consideration of contextualized risks confronting enterprises operating in these environments. By dissecting six cases that successfully adopted blockchain technology in China, we present findings of a grounded theory study into the deployment of blockchain for managing contextualized risks and opportunistic risks. Findings reveal that applying blockchain can augment risk management by controlling opportunistic risk, the latter of which denotes the variability arising from opportunistic practices of internal agents or external parties afforded by their immediate socio-economic environment. Particularly, we not only identify credibility, predatory, and compliance risk as three distinct types of opportunistic risk stemming from the unique socio-economic environment of China, but we also illustrate how blockchain could be leveraged to deal with such opportunistic risks through trust-evoking mechanisms. We discovered that blockchain could evoke trust between individuals-to-organization, organization-to-organization, and organization-to-individuals by bolstering competency, fostering benevolence, and gauging integrity in individual, inter-organizational and intra-organizational contexts, respectively.",

        "Abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) has increased the need for security due to the participation of illegitimate packets resulting from poor processing times and inadequate resource utilizations. In recent days, wireless 5G users, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) users, have accessed networks from great distances due to their mobility, which requires multiple handovers between communication technologies. However, the process generates illegitimate packets due to connectivity changes. This paper addresses the security issue by using a modified blockchain and handover authentication. The access points (APs) in the infrastructure plane authenticate the 5G users with a hash generation using their identities and pseudo IDs with a lightweight QUARK algorithm. If an excessive number of users are connected with the same AP, then the users\u2019 handover is performed by edge servers based on probabilities. In the data plane, OpenFlow switches perform a flow rule validation and a honeypot implementation for performing the packet validation. Classification of packets into normal, malicious and suspicious packets is also performed at the edge server using a capsule neural network (CapsNet). Deployment of NFV-enabled virtual switches (vSwitch) reduces switch overloading based on the load threshold. For faster validation, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is implemented at the control plane to store the hashed credentials of the users for authentication and the hashed flow rules for flow rule validation. Suspicious packet validation is performed at the control plane by the controller using the Soft Actor\u2013Critic (SAC) algorithm, and the Honey Badger Optimization algorithm (HBO) is used to select an optimal underloaded controller for efficient load balancing. This model is developed in NS-3, and the results show that our model outperforms the existing approaches in terms of QoS metrics such as bandwidth, response time, delay and packet loss, and security metrics such as detection accuracy and authentication time.",

        "Abstract": "This study is concerned with the development of the axiomatic design (AD) method under an interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment and its application in evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chains. Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD. The proposed model is used to prioritize blockchain deployment projects in a real-life case study.",

        "Abstract": "A software pattern is a reusable solution to address a commonly occurring problem within a given context when designing software. Using patterns is a common practice for software architects to ensure software quality. Many pattern collections have been proposed for a large number of application domains. However, because of the technology's recentness, there are only a few available collections with a lack of extensive testing in industrial blockchain applications. It is also difficult for software architects to adequately apply blockchain patterns in their applications, as it requires deep knowledge of blockchain technology. Through a systematic literature review, this paper has identified 120 unique blockchain-related patterns and proposes a pattern taxonomy composed of multiple categories, built from the extracted pattern collection. The purpose of this collection is to map, classify, and describe all the available patterns across the literature to help readers make adequate decisions regarding blockchain pattern selection. This study also shows potential applications of those patterns and identifies the relationships between blockchain patterns and other non-blockchain software patterns.",

        "Abstract": "Since Bitcoin's success, there has been a greater emphasis on researching the use of blockchain in a wide range of applications, such as agriculture, education, government, voting systems, etc. This generation of Blockchain applications is termed blockchain 3.0. Blockchain technology provides enhanced security, auditability, privacy, accountability, and many more features over a centralized system. Fraud in insurance is an international problem affecting all insurance subdomains in both developed and developing countries. Fraud, corruption, and many other data-related problems are threatening the financial security of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana and if not attended to, the core aims of the scheme to provide universal healthcare services will not be realized. Consequently, the objective of this work is to design and implement a blockchain-based solution to protect the NHIS from plummeting financially. This paper presents the conceptual view of the proposed system, sequence and use case diagrams, data management framework, smart notification system, and smart claim processing system. The system was evaluated using the DeLone & McLean Information Systems Success Model. It was used to validate the behavioural aspect of the system. The study discovered a significant influence of information quality and user satisfaction. On the contrary, system quality seems to have an almost significant influence on the use and user satisfaction of the proposed system.",

This paper proposes a decentralized blockchain-enabled framework network infrastructure to improve wireless security and mitigate new wireless attacks on connected consumer electronics as a proof of concept. The system model of the proposed framework was verified mathematically and was then implemented and tested in case studies. The experimental results show that the proposed decentralized blockchain technology-featured air-cracking tool (BTFAT) provides a robust detection of vulnerabilities in the security of wireless-based IoT consumer electronics, i.e., 97% in terms of the effectiveness of packet chapters and 85% in terms of the maximum capture packet reliability, compared with the state of the art.",

        "Abstract": "In the past few years, blockchain has proven its necessity and unprecedented prospects in providing a secure environment for information exchange between two parties. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.",

        "Abstract": "The emergence of a data-driven society has sparked interest in data trading marketplaces. Traditional centralized marketplaces are unable to meet the needs of a transparent, safe, and privacy-protected data marketplace. To address the above challenges, we propose a data marketplace on blockchain with arbitration using side-contracts mechanisms (dMOBAs), in which a consortium of data owners, data buyers, and arbitrators collaborate to create an ecosystem in the blockchain\u2019s witnesses. Our marketplace\u2019s goals are to provide a decentralized platform for trading personal data for both service providers and data owners. In the meantime, the transaction method can be arbitrated. The arbitrators alliance, which is responsible for resolving data disputes, is formed by a service provider jointly nominated by the buyer and seller. The integrity and value of transacted data can be validated thanks to the arbitrators\u2019 consortium. The side-contracts concept decreases the public chain\u2019s overhead and enhances the marketplace\u2019s operating efficiency. The marketplace\u2019s orderly functioning is ensured by explicit incentives and rigorous arbitration methods. To demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the mechanisms, we implement dMOBAs on Ethereum, Fabric and IPFS platforms and analyze its performance. According to the testing results, our arbitration method is 2 times faster than full public chain-based arbitration.",

        "Abstract": "Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today\u2019s systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.",

        "Abstract": "Since the advent of blockchain, interest in the technology has rapidly increased, bringing the launch of new blockchain services. User experience (UX) research provides a basis for systematically understanding and improving the experience of users, and must be carried out regardless of service type. However, it seems that research on the UX of blockchain services has not kept up with the speed with which blockchain technology has been implemented. To remedy this situation, this study proposes a UX framework for understanding the nature of UX in blockchain services. An extensive literature survey related to UX, blockchain technology, and blockchain services was conducted to define UX in blockchain services and identify the elements of UX. Blockchain functions and values that had been newly introduced in blockchain services were identified to help clarify the nature of UX in blockchain services. The proposed framework consists of two parts: a general UX and a technological UX. The elements and sub-elements of the defined UX are derived with detailed explanations. The proposed framework was applied to four blockchain services as a case study. The appropriateness and applicability of the framework are supported by the results of this case study. This study is expected to inspire researchers to provide enhanced UX in blockchain services in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic Health monitoring system has performed an essential role in managing healthcare monitoring. E-health can provide effective and valuable facilities for the patients to monitor. Though, there are protection disputes in the current E-Health system. The current e-health system, on the other hand, has security issues. Malevolent doctors may work together with cloud Storage Service Providers (CSPs) to interfere with patients' electronic health records (EHRs) or promptly leak EHR matter to other enemies for income.

For profit, EHRs or directly divulge the EHR content of EHRs to other opponents. Block-chain has recently appeared as one of the most powerful methods in the protection and secrecy fields. It is assumed to be the promised security approach that will eventually replace the security challenges in existing e-health monitoring systems. Encryption in blockchain refers to technical methods that make accessing encrypted data difficult for unauthorized resources. This research proposed a blockchain-based encryption framework to provide security-based solutions using a computational intelligence methodology.

        "Abstract": "The technological revolution in blockchain achieved the healthcare sector and offered a significant opportunity to lead this digital transformation. A significant problem is that various healthcare organizations keep numerous and fragmented patient medical records. The proposed platform solves this problem by integrating electronic medical reports in a private and permissioned blockchain to create a distributed electronic health record (EHR) ecosystem. In this context, the information processing theory (IPT) allowed us to design and validate a blockchain-based EHR system enhancing the storage of medical records and data exchange among healthcare providers and reducing environmental uncertainty. The potential benefits of the implementation of our distributed network regard clinical outcomes (e.g., improved quality, reduced medical errors), organizational outcomes (e.g., financial, operational benefits), and managerial outcomes (e.g., improved ability to conduct research, improved population health, reduced costs). Future research directions concern the application of the proposed blockchain platform to a vast extent of healthcare services and organizations.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technologies have been applied in many areas, from economics, the internet of things to the industrial internet. In order to solve the issue that the Hyperledger Fabric does not currently support Chinese Commercial Cryptographic (CCC) algorithms, we extended the Blockchain Cryptographic Service Provider (BCCSP) module in the Hyperledger Fabric by upgrading the original BCCSP module to support the CCC algorithms SM2 and SM3. Furthermore, we designed a transaction process by using UBCCSP (Upgraded BCCSP), and a new smart contract also has been presented. After that, an improved consortium blockchain information system based on UBCCSP named UCBIS (Consortium Blockchain Information System based on UBCCSP) is proposed. In the Hyperledger Fabric transaction process, the identity information and transaction data are protected by the SM2 and SM3 algorithms, moreover, SM3 is also used in the construction process of smart contracts. Our smart contracts reduce the total data amount and improve query efficiency. Finally, the information query system based on UBCCSP is implemented. After being tested and analyzed, the average time for every query is only 31.162 ms in the blockchain system, which has better performance and higher query efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Edge computing has been widely applied in video streaming systems, aiming to provide low-latency video streaming services. However, limited resources and a lack of incentivization affect the performance of edge video streaming systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient Joint computing Offloading and Resource Allocation (JORA) method for blockchain-supported edge video streaming systems (BEVS). Specifically, we develop a novel incentive mechanism based on the blockchain smart contract to enable automatic incentivization. Meanwhile, we customize a system prototype of BEVS on Amazon EC2 using Apache Storm. Preliminary experiments with the customized prototype reveal the coupling impacts of the offloading mode, the allocation scheme, and video redundancy on system performance and resource demand. Motivated by the results, we formulate joint computing offloading, resource allocation, and video adaptive compression as an optimization problem. We transform the original problem into a convex problem and a mixed-integer programming problem (MIP). We then develop an algorithm based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to solve the original problem in an iterative way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves full resource utilization and an effective trade-off between energy consumption and accuracy.",

It's limited to short distances where the delicate aerial communication system can share a spectrum with terrestrial systems. Moreover, severe privacy and security concerns are due to the unlicensed broadcasting and wireless UAV transmission networks. Therefore, this paper focus on developing a blockchain-based spectrum trading and sharing system that addresses security concerns and maintains user privacy. Mobile network operators can exchange spectrum without relying on a third party using a Distributed Blockchain Consortium System (DBCS). As a result, data is well-protected from plaintext, stalker, and ciphertext attacks, making it easier to track, manage, and control services. Experimental; results showed that the proposed DBCS outperformed other conventional systems in terms of security and performance.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid advancement of cloud computing, cloud storage services have developed rapidly. One issue that has attracted particular attention in such remote storage services is that cloud storage servers are not enough to reliably save and maintain data, which greatly affects users\u2019 confidence in purchasing and consuming cloud storage services. Traditional data integrity auditing techniques for cloud data storage are centralized, which faces huge security risks due to single-point-of-failure and vulnerabilities of central auditing servers. Blockchain technology offers a new approach to this problem. Many researchers have endeavored to employ the blockchain for data integrity auditing. Based on the search of relevant papers, we found that existing literature lacks a thorough survey of blockchain-based integrity auditing for cloud data. In this paper, we make an in-depth survey on cloud data integrity auditing based on blockchain. Firstly, we cover essential basic knowledge of integrity auditing for cloud data and blockchain techniques. Then, we propose a series of requirements for evaluating existing Blockchain-based Data Integrity Auditing (BDIA) schemes. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of existing BDIA schemes and evaluate them based on our proposed criteria. Finally, according to our completed review and analysis, we explore some open issues and suggest research directions worthy of further efforts in the future.",

        "Abstract": "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) emerged as an innovative computer technology capable of ensuring information security through encryption algorithms. In recent years, this technology has been discussed in different industries, including the construction sector. Although the advantages of applying DLT in construction projects are numerous, several barriers and limitations are associated with its application. The difficulties are even more exacerbated when examining the uses of DLT for achieving more sustainable buildings. In this context, this article conducts a comprehensive literature review on blockchain, the most discussed DLT technology nowadays, for sustainability, focusing on extending key applications discussed in various fields to the construction industry and real estate. The novelty of this review paper is the presentation of an in-depth discussion of what the next steps in blockchain research should be in order to integrate its applications for achieving a sustainable construction environment with cleaner production and resource use efficiency. A conceptual framework is also proposed to showcase the integration of blockchain with other applications for facilitating the goal of achieving sustainable buildings, including Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA).",

The present article intends to tackle this issue with a twofold contribution. The first is an analysis of the shift from economics to tokenomics highlighting the central role played by tokens within blockchain-based ecosystems. The second is a framework for tokens design leveraging a morphological analysis deeply grounded in the literature. As blockchain becomes a mainstream phenomenon, the value of the work proposed lies in lowering the cognitive barriers and in clarifying the space of available options for private and public actors willing to leverage tokenization in their daily operations.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchains are commonly used for crypto-currency systems, where they publicly store transactions. In a permissioned blockchain, only a few participants (nodes) can push new transactions to the chain. The known boundary on the number of faulty participants \u2013 up to f for 3f+1 participants \u2013 may be surpassed, causing the underlying consensus algorithm (BFT) to fail. When a malicious adversary compromises or corrupts enough nodes it may lead to the complete corruption of the ledger and even to the destruction of ledger copies the nodes hold. We suggest a reconstruction solution for the blockchain in the event of such an attack. We present a technique using verifiable secret sharing (VSS), making our solution immediate, requires no trust between the different blockchain parties, and provides each user an independent reconstruction. Our solution enables the exposure of an end-user's private key in case of dishonest reconstruction, thus, removing the incentive of such an act.",

Asmost of theIoT devices are resource-constrained in terms of computing power, storage capacity, and energy consumption. Meanwhile,the enormous computational consumption in the consensus process of the blockchain makes it difficult to integrate with IoT closely and exert the great potential of BCoT. latterly, the \u201dcloud mining\u201d mechanism has been proposed to address these issues, however,some potential problems still exist, such as data privacy and dishonest cloud mining pools, etc. In this paper, we propose a verifiable and privacy-preserving cloud mining pool selection scheme in BCoT (namely, VPP-CMPS). To obtain a better solution for cloud mining pool selection, we implement an improved time-locked puzzles technique to identify dishonest mining pools and perform the authenticity for mining pool selection.Afterwards,we obtain the privacy protection of the data during the entire selection process by adopting additively homomorphic ElGamal cryptosystem. Meanwhile, considering the resource-constrained case in IoT devices, we use a semi-honest cloud server to cooperate in dealing with the selection procedure, thereby reducing the computational overhead of IoT devices. Experimental results indicate that our scheme is more efficient and provides less computational cost.",

In this paper, we explore the impact of blockchain implementation on CSR efforts along a supply chain consisting of one supplier and one retailer under the supplier Stackelberg and retailer Stackelberg models. We consider a group of consumers with CSR awareness who have concerns about the supplier's greenwashing behavior. The adoption of blockchain helps the supply chain members foster consumers\u2019 trust about CSR involvement, by linking CSR related information nodes to blockchain. We identify the conditions where blockchain implementation makes the supplier be more responsible. The supplier has stronger incentives to adopt blockchain when undertaking sufficiently high penalty after violation detection. Under the situation, the supplier makes more CSR efforts which is efficient in the presence of blockchain to eliminate consumers\u2019 concerns about greenwashing. For the retailer, blockchain implementation is beneficial when the detection is efficient enough without blockchain and the penalty cost is not significantly high.",

        "Title": "Blockchain assisted clustering with Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Internet of Things environment",
        "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 has the potential to create new industrial revolution by offering intelligent, secure, independent, and self-adaptive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. These IIoT nodes can be grouped via the clustering process into clusters to enhance networks\u2019 efficiency, lifetime, and scalability. However, it offers several benefits but still security is a primary concern, which can be resolved by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and blockchain technology. Therefore, an effective Blockchain-Assisted Cluster-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT, called the BAC-IDS technique has been devised. The proposed BAC-IDS model aims to cluster the IIoT devices for detecting the intrusions and enabling blockchain-based secure data transmission. BAC-IDS technique involves Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based clustering technique to choose the Cluster Heads (CH) effectively and construct clusters accordingly. In addition, Chicken Swarm Optimization with Gated Recurrent Unit-based intrusion detection is also followed to determine the presence of intrusions in IIoT environment. Moreover, blockchain technology enables secure data transmission from Cluster Members (CMs) to CHs. The design of HHO clustering and CSO-based hyperparameter optimization for the IIoT environment represents the novelty of the proposed work. A wide range of simulations are performed under different aspects. From experimental results, it has been observed that the BAC-IDS approach has gained a TNR (99.97%), AUC (99.96%), precision (99.99%), recall (99.97%), accuracy (99.98%), F-score (99.98%) and error rate (0.03) on NSL-KDD2015 dataset. Further, on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it has obtained TNR (99.96%), AUC (99.98%), precision (99.96%), recall (99.98%), accuracy (99.97%), F-score (99.96%), and error rate (0.04). The experimental results highlight the supremacy of the proposed BAC-IDS technique over current state-of-art techniques.",

        "Abstract": "Today's systems, approaches, and technologies leveraged for managing oil and gas supply chain operations fall short of providing operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance features. Also, a large portion of the existing systems are centralized, manual, and highly disintegrated, which make them vulnerable to manipulation and the single point of failure problem. In this survey, we explore the potential opportunities and applications of blockchain technology in managing the exploration, production, and supply chain and logistics operations in the oil and gas industry as it can offer traceability, immutability, transparency, and audit features in a decentralized, trusted, and secure manner. We discuss state-of-the-art blockchain-based schemes, research projects, business initiatives, and case studies to highlight the practicability of blockchain in the oil and gas industry. We present the potential opportunities brought about by blockchain technology in various use cases and application scenarios. We present several systems that use blockchain-based smart contracts to automate critical services such as petroleum product tracking and tracing, international trade document protection, and coordination of purchasing and bidding activities for granting oil exploration rights to petroleum exploration and development companies. Finally, we present open challenges acting as future research directions.",

        "Title": "A blockchain-based application for genomic access and variant discovery using smart contracts and homomorphic encryption",
        "Abstract": "Genomic data repositories are rapidly growing due to the decline in the cost of DNA sequencing. This has increased the demand from stakeholders such as researchers to analyze these datasets to advance areas in biomedical research. Genomic datasets are mostly maintained by third-party direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic companies who operate a business model of collecting DNA data from their customers and selling them to pharmaceutical companies. This puts the privacy of their customers at risk since each individual\u2019s human genome is unique. In addition, customers lose ownership of and access to their genomic data to DTCs and DTCs do not share profits from data sales with them. In this paper, we propose a system based on blockchain technology and homomorphic computation to address the aforementioned problems. We use blockchain transactions and smart contracts to allow genomic data owners (DOs) to have control of their data and sell access to it, and homomorphic computation with secure two-party protocol to enable genomic data users (DUs) to run queries to securely discover DOs of interest. We further optimize the query response time by proposing an approach based on genomic data partitions, binary search trees and bloom filters to reduce the search space. We also propose a blockchain penalty mechanism to encourage parties to behave honestly to avoid malicious behaviors such as uploading fake or non-human genomic data. We conduct our experiments on real genomic datasets and demonstrate that our proposed scheme allows DOs to control access to their data and is feasible and efficient in terms of computation cost, query response time and scalability.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) are separately regarded as highly capable popular technologies. Blockchain is a database used for decentralized transaction purposes. It provides novel directions to store and manage data, whereas IoT relates to the propagation of linked machines by providing information through the Internet. A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment. Furthermore, the BIIoT system enables us to communicate with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary in a decentralized, unreliable, peer-to-peer network.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain and big data are the emerging technologies that are on the highest agendas of the firms. These are significantly expected to transform the ways in which the business as well as the firm run. These are on the verge of increasing the expectation of the distributed ledgers, which would keep the firms away from struggling challenges. The concept of big data and Blockchain has been used up by various other concepts that would help secure and interpret the information. The ideal solutions offered by these technologies shall address the challenges of big data management as well as for analytics. In addition to that, Blockchain provides its own consensus method, which is the primary means to create an audit trail. This enables users to verify all transactions. The audit trail is a means of verifying the correctness and integrity of every transaction, regardless of who owns the asset. The Blockchain can also verify that different parties of a transaction are following an agreement and not breaking the agreement. Moreover, there have been continuous arguments in the concept of Blockchain at which the bitcoin is fundamental and there are several popular blockchain approaches developed which would deliver performance, security as well as privacy. Apart from this, the use of Blockchain plays a major role in adding an extra data layer for the big data analytics process. Big data is considered secure which cannot be further forged with the network architecture. The current paper shall be discussing the emerging concepts that are using Blockchain as well as big data.",

        "Abstract": "Bitcoin is the largest blockchain, and provides the underlying UTXO architecture used by many other cryptocurrencies. We identify an inherent bias embedded in this architecture (the Notebreaker mechanism) which forces users to \u2018spend\u2019 the entire content of a wallet address in order to make a payment, receiving \u2018change\u2019 into a unique new address. This inflates both the apparent volume transacted and network users, as well as minimizing the apparent fees of transacting. We develop an innovative Transaction Identification Methodology (TIM) to quantify the economic value of transactions from raw blockchain data. Using four different algorithms across three stages, we achieve 95% accuracy in quantifying the degree of bias in these measures. Validated across more than 430 million Bitcoin transactions involving 600 million wallet addresses, our methodology reveals that the Notebreaker mechanism inflates transaction volumes 8 times, makes the actual costs of blockchain transactions appear 3\u20137 times more expensive than what is commonly reported, and inflates wallet counts \u2013 a common heuristic of unique adopter counts. We provide a remediation strategy to make Bitcoin blockchain data a more accurate representation of reality, and provide a daily data set of these remediated volumes and transaction fees.",

        "Abstract": "The profitability of a supply chain (SC) is proportional to the stability of all its stakeholders as well as their consistent information sharing with an effective and efficient communication mechanism. Various inefficiencies, such as bullwhip effect (BWE) and product unavailability, may be caused by lack of coordination in a SC. The importance of sharing consumer demand has been quantified by comprehensive studies, under the assumption that all SC participants will access the same information. However, only a few studies have studied the effect of minimal coordination or limited visibility of information, while considering their effect on the overall efficiency of a SC. This work primarily leverages blockchain technology (BCT) to create a simulation model. To do this, a SC bullwhip effect base model is initially developed. Following that, a blockchain-based robust information sharing system is simulated. Furthermore, information sharing is challenging and SC stakeholders may not really trust each other and hence be reluctant to share sensitive information. Considering that, this paper proposed an improved Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm that will increase trust in a decentralized SC model. Multiple experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and the simulation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of information sharing in a supply chain via blockchain (BC), as well as that trust between partners tends to increase overall SC efficiency and reduce BWE.",

        "Title": "Blockchain humanitarianism and crypto-colonialism",
        "Abstract": "A critical political economy approach to new technologies is key to discerning suitable use cases from highly ideological projects. This perspective considers the emergence of blockchain and cryptocurrencies in the aid sector. The ability of blockchain enthusiasts to experiment with governance and payment platforms in the developing world is a result of the ascendant private-public partnership (PPP) model in the non-governmental organization (NGO) sector, which has increasingly aligned itself with Silicon Valley\u2019s cultural values. This overview of flagship blockchain projects finds end-user solutions and outcomes that principally serve a public-relations (PR) function for the broader crypto-economy and extend colonial legacies of experimentation in the developing world. This paper argues that blockchain humanitarianism is inseparable from crypto-colonialism as the developers, platforms, and rhetoric are interchangeable. A minimal requirement for an ethically sound blockchain humanitarian project would involve acknowledging the risk and ideological extremism of crypto, the importance of developing world sovereignty, and the legacies of colonialism through technological abstraction. The ethical failings of the PPP model in this case should be read alongside the scholarship of Madianou and Nothias and point to the need for developing world platform self-determination analogous to the Non-Aligned Movement\u2019s call for a New World Information and Communication Order.",

        "Title": "A drone-based data management and optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and blockchain smart contracts in a secure fog environment",
        "Abstract": "The advent of fog computing as an extension of cloud-enabling technology has moved from the hub of the internet framework to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled control and management of drone-based data. The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious challenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone-ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .",

        "Abstract": "The traditional process of patent registration and trading is very complex, often hindered by challenges related to information security and patent traceability. As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.",

        "Title": "Security of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using blockchain: A comprehensive review",
        "Abstract": "The most advanced and emerging component of an intelligent transportation system (ITS) is the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Vehicles communicate with nearby vehicles or road side units (RSUs) in order to provide safety or non-safety information. This information containing vehicle ID, current position, speed and vehicle status is shared periodically among nearby vehicles. VANET provides tremendous benefits to drivers, but due to its inherent characteristics, it is important to address security and privacy issues before it can be fully adopted. It is required to authenticate the vehicles participating in the network and held responsible in case any type of misbehavior is encountered in the network. Traditional centralized security solutions are not suitable in VANET because of high speed of vehicles, minimal communication resources and delay sensitive applications. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed computing platform that makes it easier to record and manage resources without relying on a centralized trusted authority. Therefore, blockchain based solution is expedient in VANET scenario which provides transparency, tamper resistance and immutableness. This paper aims to envision a comprehensive review on applications of blockchain in VANET security. We first present the introduction of VANET security and blockchain. Then, we conduct a literature review on the existing security solutions using blockchain in VANET by considering the technical issues and research problems. At last, we highlight some future research issues by reviewing the characteristics of both blockchain and VANET.",

Blockchain began its journey from the concept of cryptocurrency and is now part of a range of core applications to achieve resilience and automation between various tasks. However, with the integration of Blockchain technology into different industrial applications, many application designs, security, and privacy challenges present themselves, posing serious threats to users and their data. Although several approaches have been proposed to address the specific application, security and privacy challenges of targeted applications with limited security enhancement solutions, there is still a need for a comprehensive research study on the application design, security and privacy challenges, and requirements of Blockchain-based industrial applications, along with possible security threats and countermeasures. This study presents a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of Blockchain-based Industry 4.0 applications, focusing on potential application design, security and privacy requirements, as well as corresponding attacks on Blockchain systems with potential countermeasures. We also analyse and provide the classification of security and privacy techniques used in these applications to enhance the advancement of security features. Furthermore, we highlight some open issues of integrating Blockchain technology into industrial applications that help design secure Blockchain-based applications as future directions.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) networks are large peer-to-peer networks of small devices that require a competent security system that is scalable and adaptable to the limited resources of the IoT devices. Node authentication is a crucial part of IoT security. The current authentication solutions require a centralized trusted party for authentication, which presents a single point of failure. Blockchain as a peer-to-peer network with decentralized authentication can provide a decentralized solution for node authentication. In existing literature, most blockchain applications in IoT are connected to existing blockchain networks by more computationally capable devices, thereby limiting their adaptability for IoT networks and presenting single point of failure problem. Considering the issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized structure for authentication by arranging the IoT devices into clusters based on their computational capability, energy reserve and their location. The devices in each cluster are authenticated by a hierarchical structure of interconnected blockchains. To reduce the processing load we introduced a consensus protocol based on verifying identity-based encryption key signature of the device and its related cluster. The proposed structure simulation has shown a reduction of the processor and memory load of IoT devices. Further testing using Docker container network and Raspberry Pi devices network has shown that the proposed blockchain structure and consensus algorithm have reduced computational load. The analysis of the structure security and performance shows it offers comprehensive security protection while being lightweight and scalable.",

        "Abstract": "Owing to the incremental and diverse applications of cryptocurrencies and the continuous development of distributed system technology, blockchain has been broadly used in fintech, smart homes, public health, and intelligent transportation due to its properties of decentralization, collective maintenance, and immutability. Although the dynamism of blockchain abounds in various fields, concerns in terms of network communication interference and privacy leakage are gradually increasing. Because of the lack of reliable attack analysis systems, fully understanding some attacks on the blockchain, such as mining, network communication, smart contract, and privacy theft attacks, has remained challenging. Therefore, in this study, we examine the security and privacy of the blockchain and analyze possible solutions. We systematical classify the blockchain attack techniques into three categories, then discuss the corresponding attack and defense methods based on these categories. We focus on (1) the attack and defense methods of mining pool attacks for blockchain security issues, such as block withholding, 51%, pool hopping, selfish mining, and fork after withholding attacks, in the attack type of consensus excitation; (2) the attack and defense methods of network communication and smart contracts for blockchain security issues, such as distributed denial-of-service, Sybil, eclipse, and reentrancy attacks, in the attack type of middle protocol; and (3) the attack and defense methods of privacy thefts for blockchain privacy issues, such as identity privacy and transaction information attacks, in the attack type of application service. Finally, we discuss future research directions for blockchain security.",

        "Title": "RON-enhanced blockchain propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities",
        "Abstract": "Edge computing can serve latency-sensitive data generated by smart IoT devices in smart cities, which cannot be accommodated by cloud services. However, edge-enabled smart cities applications face many security issues such as massive centralization, vulnerability to tampering, and tracing difficulty. Blockchain, as an emerging ledger technology, can be a useful solution to these problems. However, due to network propagation delay, blockchain fork may occur in the network of edge-enabled smart cities at some time. It can lead to double payment attacks and damage data integrity. To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain network propagation mechanism based on the resilient overlay network (RON) for edge-enabled smart cities. Firstly, it reconstructs the networking mode between the blockchain nodes in smart cities based on RON so that the blockchain nodes can quickly detect the link state of the Internet in smart cities. The shortest path algorithm and policy routing are then applied to construct the propagation path between the blockchain nodes to optimize the Gossip propagation mechanism and enhance the QoS and QoE. Simulation results show that the RON-based blockchain network propagation mechanism for edge-enabled smart cities is beneficial in terms of average route hop count, transmission success rate, routing overhead, average delay, and reduced fork probability.",

        "Abstract": "This study explores the relative impact of blockchain-enabled sustainability labeling on consumers purchasing behavior when shopping for fashion products. A conjoint experiment was conducted where participants (n=84) assigned scores to stimuli cards according to preference in a specific shopping scenario. Results showed that \u201cblockchain trademarked\u201d did not have much impact relative to \u201clow price\u201d and \u201chigh product rating\u201d. Further analysis showed that \u201cblockchain trademarked\u201d had a relatively stronger impact towards those participants (n=22) who indicated that living a sustainable lifestyle is important. Our findings show that there is a need for educating consumers about blockchain and the associated benefits for improving future transparency in sustainability in the fashion industry. Overall, these findings provide valuable grounds for further research on how blockchain-enabled sustainability labeling can create value for both consumers and companies within the fashion industry.",

        "Abstract": "The digitalization of the power grid and advancement in intelligent technologies have enabled the service provider to convert the existing electrical grid into a smart grid. The transformation of the grid will help in integrating cleaner energy technologies with energy management to improve power network efficiency. Internet of things (IoT) and various network components need to be deployed to harness the full potential of the smart grid. Also, integrating intermittent renewable energy sources, energy storage, intelligent control of selected power-intensive loads, etc will improve energy efficiency. But deployment of this information and communication technologies will make the grid more vulnerable to cyber attacks from hackers. In this work, blockchain-based self-sovereign identification and authentication technique is presented to avert identity theft and masquerading. The proposed approach can minimize the chances of identity-based security breaches in the smart grid. This paper provides an overview of the model of identification and authentication of IoT devices in Smart Grid based on Blockchain technology. The Blockchain based implementation of identification and authentication of devices is proposed to validate the model in the distributed electrical energy network. The model is able to authenticate the device using Blockchain in a trusted model. The system works according to plan validating the authenticity of transaction in a node in log(n) time, which justifies presented result.",

        "Abstract": "Big data has generated strong interest in various scientific and engineering domains over the last few years. Despite many advantages and applications, there are many challenges in big data to be tackled for better quality of service, e.g., big data analytics, big data management, and big data privacy and security. Blockchain with its decentralization and security nature has the great potential to improve big data services and applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on blockchain for big data, focusing on up-to-date approaches, opportunities, and future directions. First, we present a brief overview of blockchain and big data as well as the motivation behind their integration. Next, we survey various blockchain services for big data, including blockchain for secure big data acquisition, data storage, data analytics, and data privacy preservation. Then, we review the state-of-the-art studies on the use of blockchain for big data applications in different domains such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart grid. For a better understanding, some representative blockchain-big data projects are also presented and analyzed. Finally, challenges and future directions are discussed to further drive research in this promising area.",

        "Abstract": "In order to have transactions executed and recorded on blockchains such as the Ethereum Mainnet, fees expressed in crypto-currency units of the blockchain must be paid. One can buy crypto-currency called Ether of the Ethereum blockchain from exchanges and pay for the transaction fees. In the case of test networks (such as Rinkeby) or scientific research blockchains (such as Bloxberg), free crypto-currency, Ether, is distributed to users via faucets. Since transaction slots on the blocks, storage and smart contract executions are consuming blockchain resources, Ethers are distributed by fixed small amounts to users. Users may have different amount of Ether requirements; some small amounts and some large amounts during different times. As a result, rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more general distribution mechanism that allows a user to demand and claim arbitrary amounts of Ether, while satisfying fairness among users, is needed. For this end, Max\u2013min Fairness based schemes have been used in centralised settings. Our work contributes a Max\u2013min Fairness based algorithm and its Solidity smart contract implementation that requires low transaction costs independent of the number of users. This is important on the Ethereum blockchain, since a smart contract execution with transaction costs depending on the number of users would mean block gas limit exhaustion problem will eventually be met, making the smart contract ineffective. We report tests which confirm that the low transaction cost aims have been achieved by our algorithm.",

Identity management is believed to be the fundamental keystone to build security mechanisms. The traditional centralized identity management scheme suffers from a single point of failure and identity forgery. A secure IoT system framework was proposed leveraging blockchain as the basic infrastructure with Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) identifying the sensors uniquely. We brought up a scheme to improve the identity authentication protocol. Experiments showed that our approach was more effective and secure against attacks.",

Each electronic health system(EHS) usually allows its subsystems to manage and access patient data to achieve its unique objective. Due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of the terminal, it is difficult to protect large amounts of patients\u2019 medical record data in EHS. Medical data are a meaningful medical history resource, and are very important for the treatment and rehabilitation of patients. The privacy and integrity protection of medical data is a on-negotiable requirement for rational application in traditional medical systems. To achieve secure resource sharing and efficient service provision between users and medical service providers, we present a blockchain-based decentralized authentication and access control protocol for EHS that addresses broader medical data privacy and security needs. A practical Byzantine fault-tolerant(PBFT) negotiation mechanism based on multi-weighted subjective logic is adopted to improve the negotiation process. Finally, using BAN logic, we prove the reliability of the systems-security protections, which demonstrates that our proposal can withstand known security attacks.",

Energy consumption and application delay have been taken as the study\u2019s objectives. The system proposes different schemes, such as Deadline Latency Energy. The work devises the Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Algorithm Framework (DLEBAF) with different strategies. The first strategy is deadline-efficient task sequencing and scheduling (DETS), which allocates all applications (workloads) according to their deadline. The second strategy is latency-efficient task scheduling (LETS) to minimize the latency of workloads. The third strategy is energy-efficient task scheduling (EETS), which reduces the energy of fog nodes. The blockchain-enabled fog\u2013cloud (BEFC) scheme ensures the blockchain validation, hashing, previous hash, and time of applications in the system. The results will compare the optimal energy results and delay existing studies with the proposed work. Results showed that the proposed method improves by 30% energy and 50% training delay of all applications.",

        "Abstract": "Recording vehicle driving data into the blockchain can effectively solve problems of data authenticity and security, which is a focus of research on blockchain and the Internet of Vehicles. However, when using blockchain technology, the proof-of-work completed by vehicles may consume substantial energy and computing resources, which limits the application of blockchain technology in the internet of vehicles environment. Therefore, this paper considers deploying edge computing nodes to support blockchain technology and introducing an auction mechanism to encourage users to record vehicle driving data as miners. This paper proposes two auction mechanisms for the blockchain network formed by edge computing service providers and miners to maximize the social welfare. Specifically, one mechanism is used when the resource demands of the miners are the same, and the other is used when the resource demands of the miners are different. For resource allocation, the former uses the maximum cost maximum flow algorithm to achieve optimal allocation, and the latter uses a heuristic algorithm. For price payment, the former uses the Vickrey\u2013Clarke\u2013Groves mechanism, and the latter uses dichotomy. These two price payment algorithms use critical value theory to calculate the payment price. This paper demonstrates that both are truthful and individually rational. Through experiments, this paper evaluates indicators such as social welfare, satisfaction, and resource utilization. The experiments show that the proposed auction mechanism can effectively maximize social welfare in the blockchain network and provide an effective resource allocation strategy for edge computing service providers.",

The results of our evaluation indicate that while a private permissioned blockchain can meet the requirements to some degree, the governance element is key to legal compliance; legal risks and ethical implications remain unresolved with the use of blockchain. The paper also found that this model comes with the loss of the main advantages of blockchain \u2013 decentralization and anonymity.

        "Abstract": "Alliance blockchains provide a multi-party trusted data trading environment, promoting the development of the data trading market in which the value compensation for personal data is still a key issue. However, limited by the data format and content, traditional attempts on data value compensation cannot form a widely applicable solution. Therefore, we propose a universal value compensation method for personal data in alliance blockchains. The basic idea of this method is to evaluate the value weight of data based on the collaborative relationship of data value. First, we construct a Data Collaboration Markov Model (DCMM) to formalize the collaboration network of data value. Then, aiming at data collaboration networks with different structures, the corresponding Segmented PageRank (SPR) algorithm is proposed. SPR can universally evaluate the value weight of each data account without being subjected to the data format or content. Finally, we theoretically deduce that the time complexity and space complexity of SPR algorithm are respectively 1/K and 1/K2 taken by PageRank algorithm. Experiments show the feasibility and superior performance of SPR.",

        "Abstract": "Electronic auctions are becoming more and more popular in business activities, which provide the professionals with competitive prices for their products, pitching the suppliers directly against each other to allow suppliers to bid online against a published specification. In sealed-bid e-auctions, bidders send sealed-bid envelopes to auctioneer and auctioneer only can open them after a certain period of time to announce the highest bidder. In order to solve the issue of the opacity of whole sealed-bid auction process, researchers try to solve this problem by incorporating the blockchain technique into the e-auction systems with the properties of unforgeable transaction and public ledger of the blockchain. However, since the auctioneer might open the bid envelope before the deadline of the auction, it can tamper the bid price by colluding with malicious bidders for personal profit. In this paper, we propose a time-released blockchain-based sealed-bid e-auction scheme. We use time-lock encryption to ensure that the bidders\u2019 bid data will not be available to anyone until a specified time, thus guaranteeing the security of the bidders\u2019 data. At the same time, we use smart contracts for auction verification, which further improves the security of the scheme and avoids tampering by malicious auctioneers. In addition, we propose a secure sealed-bid e-auction scheme with fair arbitration (namely, SSBAS-FA), that is based on time-released blockchain to provide a fair arbitration mechanism in punishing malicious bidders. We give the deployment of a time-released blockchain that eliminates the demand of the trusted third party to perform the validation of the smart contract. We provide the fair arbitration for the bidder and auctioneer. The security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that our scheme is secure, fair and efficient in sealed-bid e-auction system.",

        "Abstract": "The healthcare data management system faces critical challenges related to data transparency, traceability, immutability, auditing, secure data provenance, and trust. This study aimed to provide a prospective overview of how blockchain technology can efficiently improve medical record management. Blockchain technology, an emerging and disruptive decentralized technology, is poised to impact the way data is handled in the healthcare industry significantly. As a result of this technology, we can fill out a patient's medical record efficiently and validated. Blockchain helps form a single network in which different organizations can safely share their records by forming a chain by linking it privately to store records like radiographic or different images. Blockchain-based digital platforms allow patients to interact with their data providers, including healthcare providers, in a seamless, fast and simple way. Numerous open research challenges, which we identify and explore, are inhibiting the successful implementation of blockchain in the healthcare sector. In this chapter, we have discussed the way that Electronic Medical Records is managed by blockchain, and this novel technology can be used in creating an efficient as well as interoperation infrastructure that helps in maintaining the record of patients that deals in improving the healthcare outcomes at the same time it also maintains its integrity and privacy of the essential data. We also discuss both existing and recent developments of management data in healthcare based on the blockchain model. We highlight the primary benefits of implementing blockchain technology, as well as the potential for healthcare companies. We highlight a range of healthcare applications have been demonstrated using recent research and case studies. The present study identifies and explains several outstanding issues that slow the adoption of blockchain technology in health care. Finally, we propose many more research topics for discussion and investigation.",

        "Abstract": "Despite its clear potential to contribute to sustainability, there are many challenges to adopting circular economy (CE). These barriers impede the implementation of CE; however, research to address them is ongoing. For example, novel technologies have become a key enabler for easing the impact of CE adoption barriers. Blockchain is one disruptive technology that has the potential to address some of those barriers, notably technological, organizational, and ecological. Blockchain is particularly well suited to help address supply chain-oriented barriers to CE adoption. However, a review of the literature shows that while there are a limited number of conceptual studies that address the capabilities of blockchain to alleviate the impact of the barriers to CE, no previous study has focused on this vital subject using a decision tool based on expert data. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated decision framework involving Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-based Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method with Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets (HFLTS) to investigate the true potential of blockchain to address the CE adoption barriers. Our findings indicate that enhanced supply chain traceability management, improved collaboration and coordination in supply chain ecosystems, building higher levels of trust in supply chain ecosystems, and enhanced business models are the most significant functions of blockchain to help overcome the CE adoption barriers.",

        "Abstract": "The wealth of user data acts as a fuel for network intelligence toward the sixth generation wireless networks (6G). Due to data heterogeneity and dynamics, decentralized data management (DM) is desirable for achieving transparent data operations across network domains, and blockchain can be a promising solution. However, the increasing data volume and stringent data privacy-preservation requirements in 6G bring significantly technical challenge to balance transparency, efficiency, and privacy requirements in decentralized blockchain-based DM. In this paper, we investigate blockchain solutions to address the challenge. First, we explore the consensus protocols and scalability mechanisms in blockchains and discuss the roles of DM stakeholders in blockchain architectures. Second, we investigate the authentication and authorization requirements for DM stakeholders. Third, we categorize DM privacy requirements and study blockchain-based mechanisms for collaborative data processing. Subsequently, we present research issues and potential solutions for blockchain-based DM toward 6G from these three perspectives. Finally, we conclude this paper and discuss future research directions.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-assisted industrial automation beyond 5G networks",
        "Abstract": "Automation of industrial tasks becomes the necessity of organizations due to high risks and low operational efficiency associated with traditional procedures. The industrial Internet-of-thing (IIoT) has proved it a reality with ubiquitous computing, which interconnects tens of billions of objects, such as devices and machines, for real-time data transfer. However, the rapid increase in the number of connected devices and machines leads to various security issues, such as data modification, sniffing, and many more. Achieving secure and reliable communication between devices becomes challenging as the entire communication takes place over an open channel, i.e., the Internet. Most of the security solutions presented in the literature are centralized and susceptible to security, latency, reliability, and single-point-of-failure issues. Blockchain is a plausible solution to mitigate the aforementioned issues with reduced capital and operating expenditures, whereas the sixth-generation (6G) network makes communication faster and more reliable. Motivated by these facts, this paper presents an exhaustive survey on blockchain-based industrial automation in the 6G environment. Also, a blockchain and 6G-enabled industrial automation architecture for secure and efficient communication among IIoT devices is proposed. This paper also presents a case study on blockchain-based additive manufacturing for designing three-dimensional products to validate the proposed architecture. The performance of the proposed case study is evaluated based on network parameters such as delay, packet loss, scalability, network bandwidth, computation time, and data storage cost. Finally, various research challenges and future directions are suggested in this emerging area.",

        "Abstract": "Secure communication is one of the main challenges that are slowing down the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Key Management (KM) is particularly a difficult security issue, mainly because of the lack of resources of the IoT devices. Most of the existing solutions do not consider the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the IoT. They do not regard the difference in capability of its components and impose equal loads on them. Moreover, they store keys in device memories before deployment, which makes adding devices difficult afterwards. We propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based KM protocol for the IoT. Our solution balances the loads between nodes according to their capabilities. We prove that this makes it efficient and scalable. Furthermore, our solution securely rekey the network upon a change. To decentralize the KM, we use the blockchain technology and smart contracts. We show that the system continues to operate when an entity fails and that the compromise of an entity does not jeopardize the whole network. We also prove that our solution fulfills the IoT requirements in terms of security and performance. Finally, we propose an implementation on IoT platforms to validate our theoretical analysis and simulation results.",

        "Abstract": "Some of the significant new technologies researched in recent studies include Blockchain (BC), Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Smart Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). All three technology provide data integrity, confidentiality, and integrity in their respective use cases (especially in industrial fields). Additionally, cloud computing has been in use for several years now. Confidential information is exchanged with cloud infrastructure to provide clients with access to distant resources, such as computing and storage activities in the IIoT. There are also significant security risks, concerns, and difficulties associated with cloud computing. To address these challenges, we propose merging BC and SDN into a cloud computing platform for the IIoT. This paper introduces \u201cDistB-SDCloud\u201d, an architecture for enhanced cloud security for smart IIoT applications. The proposed architecture uses a distributed BC method to provide security, secrecy, privacy, and integrity while remaining flexible and scalable. Customers in the industrial sector benefit from the dispersed or decentralized, and efficient environment of BC. Additionally, we described an SDN method to improve the durability, stability, and load balancing of cloud infrastructure. The efficacy of our SDN and BC-based implementation was experimentally tested using various parameters including throughput, packet analysis, response time, bandwidth, and latency analysis, as well as the monitoring of several attacks on the system itself.",

Like in developed nations, disruptive technology is necessary to advance the traditional banking system in emerging economies. The present study aims to investigate the critical factors that influence a user's intention to accept blockchain technology for financial institutions. The proposed model is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) constructs with trust and cost-saving, tested using structural equation modelling. Findings from an online survey of 188 practitioners working in Malaysia's financial sector confirm that all constructs except trust on perceived usefulness were found to have a significant impact during the blockchain implementation. Moreover, cost-saving matters most during the disruptive technology adoption for financial institutions. Based on the findings, the subsequent theoretical and practical implications are assessed, albeit with notable limitations.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology is considered a logical solution to the problems of security, privacy and trust in the collection, storage and sharing of data related to the elderly in the elderly care industry (ECI); however, its adoption in the ECI remains in its initial stage. To improve the efficiency of adopting this technology in the ECI and to facilitate decision-making by managers, this study combines the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology\u2013organisation\u2013environment framework models to study the factors affecting blockchain adoption intention in the ECI. In addition, the direct predictors of the relative advantages of blockchain technology in the ECI are explored. Through a questionnaire survey of 124 elderly care institutions in China, we collected 181 valid questionnaires and analysed them using a partial least squares regression structural equation model. The results show that relative advantage, corporate social responsibility, top management support and organisational readiness have a positive effect on blockchain adoption intention in the ECI, while the effects of complexity, government support and competitive pressure are insignificant. However, competitive pressure and government support can indirectly promote blockchain adoption intention by influencing top management support. Furthermore, technology trust and information security positively affect the relative advantages of blockchain technology and indirectly affect blockchain adoption intention, while privacy protection is insignificant.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-Enabled Searchable Encryption in Clouds: A Review",
        "Abstract": "Nowadays, the demand of storage and computational resources is increasing. As a result, the number of organisations and individuals that outsource their data to cloud is also increasing. Since data privacy and security are the main concerns, the users always encrypt their data before uploading the data to the cloud server. However, it obstructs the search operation which is one of the basic data utilisation. Search operation can be seen as one of the most important function in daily life as people frequently search for data they wanted. When the uploaded data is encrypted, the capability of a server to search for certain keyword is limited as it is not able to carry out a plaintext keyword search on encrypted data. In order to realise the privacy needs, a cryptographic primitive called searchable encryption that allows the search of keyword over the uploaded data that is encrypted is introduced. The concept of searchable encryption has been presented to enable data users to search for certain keyword over the encrypted data without leaking any information to the cloud server. However, most of the conventional searchable encryption schemes do not offer features that satisfy the real-world application such as fair payment, verifiability of search result, etc. While blockchain is well-known with its features such as decentralised, integrity, and immutability, thus blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be discussed on how it can be used to overcome or complement the downsides of conventional searchable encryption. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes will be reviewed and compared.",

In traditional mechanisms, there always exists a tradeoff between correctness of medical data and patient privacy. Here we are going to introduce the concept of blockchain and smart contract to build up an electronic medical record sharing mechanism: medical blockchain. Specifically, we have implemented the medical record sharing through cryptography design. Simulations have demonstrated that the correctness of medical data and privacy of patient can be guaranteed through the adoption of blockchain, while the integrity of a specific patient can be achieved via the smart contract control. Furthermore, the proposed medical blockchain can resist the potential Internet attack simulated by the formal verification. Thus, no leakage of patient identity occurs, and the tradeoff could be eliminated effectively without the modification of current hospital devices according to the simulation results.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid popularization and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has become an indispensable part in today\u2019s society. However, when task participants submit tasks, they are likely to expose their data privacy and location privacy. These privacy will be maliciously attacked and exploited by attackers (external attackers and untrusted third party). With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations. To solve the problem that the third party is untrusted, we utilize Blockchain to distribute tasks and collect models in a distributed way. A reputation calculation method (Sig-RCU) is proposed to calculate the real-time reputation of task participants. Through conducting experiments on real data sets, the effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed DLD-LDP algorithm and Sig-RCU algorithm are verified.",

The selection of practical dimensions requires both Quantitative indicators also require cultural and behavioral qualitative indicators; finally, through the analysis of social development trends and government policies, the external variable landscape signals are parameterized. Sustainable energy rather than fossil energy is the energy of the future. Weak landscape signals have significantly weakened the development of the sustainable energy niche: the proportion of coal consumption has declined slowly. Although it has transformed from a system to a niche, it has always been higher than that of other energy types.

        "Abstract": "In the study, we propose a double blockchain based vehicular system for optimizing data storage and securing communication in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. We propose an incentive mechanism and a reputation system to reduce the selfish and distrustful behavior of IoV nodes. Moreover, we propose an encryption technique to protect the proposed system from passive and active attacks. The proposed technique is a hybrid of Rivest Shamir Adleman and Advanced Encryption Standard-256 (AES-256+RSA). We use this hybrid approach to efficiently and secretly share the users' secret keys. To address the issues of high resource consumption and communication delay, we propose a cache memory technique for miner and controller nodes. In addition, we propose an authentication mechanism to remove malicious nodes from the system. The simulation results depict that our system provides security, scalability, optimized data storage, node's trustworthiness, and transparent data sharing.",

        "Abstract": "\u201cBlockchain\u201d is a buzzword that has captured attention from researchers in almost every possible domain. In a blockchain ecosystem, multiple parties across the network have to establish trust in an untrusted environment to ensure seamless nonrepudiation. Nonrepudiation is a crucial factor for secure information auditing in the blockchain. To achieve this, we require an optimal digital signature. In this work, we design a digital signature to address the nonrepudiation challenge in blockchain ecosystems. Our approach developed in the current work completed signing and verification tasks with 10% and 13% shorter processing times, respectively than the conventional digital signature scheme. The adoption of the high-performance Edwards curve aggregate signature (HECAS) in a blockchain ecosystem can yield a 10% improvement in the transaction flow, a 10% improvement in block validation and a 40% decrease in storage costs relative to the same system implemented without HECAS. Finally, we simulated various blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems and experimented with our scheme. The results show that our work can produce convincing, consistent results across various sensor data types from smart IoT-based blockchain solutions.",

        "Abstract": "The selfish On-Board-Unit (OBU) attacks Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) by various attacks for profit. However, many existing methods are based on the principle of direct reciprocity for communication, which makes it easy for large-scale networks to crash when an attack occurs. In order to reduce the number of attackers in the vehicle ad hoc network and restrain the attack motivation of the OBUs, we propose an indirect reciprocal incentive mechanism based on reputation to encourage the OBUs in the VANET to help each other. Since most OBUs are in great need of network services, including potential attackers, when the loss of network services is far greater than the illegal benefits of their attacks, selfish and rational OBUs will give up attacks and take desirable behavior. In addition, to prevent some attacks from tampering with information, we also apply blockchain technology to record the behavior of OBU. The indirect reciprocity process of each OBU in VANET can be regarded as Markov Decision Process (MDP). In order to restrain the attack motivation of selfish nodes and communicate normally without knowing the attack model, an algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed to suppress attack motivation, so as to activate OBU learning in a dynamic environment and make wise decisions. Finally, through a large number of simulation experiments, the performance of our proposed algorithm is obviously better than that of the baseline strategy, and is verified by the simulation results.",

        "Abstract": "Increasingly, the apparel industry generates enormous waste and pollution causing extreme water scarcity in emerging economies, where circular economy (CE) adoption can help to alleviate these pressing issues of this century. Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer\u2019s buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.",

The main innovative aspect of this solution is the integration that is offered between an Academic Management System (the Fenix.edu platform) and a Blockchain (Ethereum) to automatically deploy diplomas. This solution helps the involved stakeholders trust the diplomas provided. The case study involves four different stakeholders and studies, specifically, the increase in their satisfaction in terms of diploma control, diploma veracity, and diploma credibility. The developed system was tested with external participants who were asked to follow a set of guidelines and complete a survey to assess their perceptions. All system interactions were recorded, and the data were analyzed. The results indicated that the participants successfully executed the guidelines and that a perception increase toward diploma control, veracity, and credibility was identified.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the limitations of data quality and quantity of a single industrial user, the development of intelligent machinery fault diagnosis methods has been reaching a bottleneck in the perspectives of both academic research and engineering applications in the recent years. Collaborative fault diagnosis model development has been receiving increasing attention, where the distributed data at different users are explored simultaneously. However, data security and privacy are the major industrial concerns, which have not been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, a blockchain-based decentralized federated transfer learning method is proposed for collaborative machinery fault diagnosis. A tailored committee consensus scheme is designed for optimization of the model aggregation process, and a source data-free transfer learning method is further proposed. After global model initialization, the fault diagnosis model can be built through iterations of committee member selection, performance evaluation, transfer learning, model aggregation and blockchain updates. The experiments on two decentralized fault diagnosis datasets are implemented for validations, and higher than 90% testing accuracies can be generally achieved. The experimental results indicate the proposed method is effective in data privacy-preserving collaborative fault diagnosis of multiple users. It offers a promising tool for applications in the real industrial scenarios.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.",

However, as the technology is still developing and the research on the implications of the different types of blockchain networks (i.e. public, private, consortium) is scarce, their role in business model innovation requires closer attention. To address this gap, the paper provides a conceptual insight into the role of blockchain technology in companies with different value configurations by examining the technological conditions that can impact business models and probing the role of technology benefits in driving company value. The analysis contributes to the literature by discussing the business implications of innovative technologies and uncovering their positive and negative consequences for the value creation, delivery and capture activities. Such analysis sheds light on the functions of blockchains that have a differentiating impact on business processes. Also, the paper puts forward managerial implications by discussing the paths of business model innovation using blockchain technologies.",

        "Abstract": "We focus on blockchain technology (BCT) adoption in a three-echelon supply chain in which upstream sellers offer trade credits to capital-constrained downstream buyers, forming an accounts receivable chain. According to different supply chain partners adopting BCT, we analyze the game equilibrium of the no, upper-stream, lower-stream, and entire BCT-driven accounts receivable chains (NBC, UBC, LBC, and EBC) to understand participants\u2019 motivation and condition to adopt BCT and the different roles of participants in blockchain introduction. We find that trade credit management cost-saving and repayment risk-sharing effects, as facilitated by BCT, help increase the equilibrium order quantity, thereby increasing supply chain efficiency and participants\u2019 profits, although BCT cannot fully coordinate the supply chain. Regarding supply chain efficiency, EBC is superior to LBC, which is better than UBC or NBC. As a supply chain leader and creditor, the supplier plays a passive role in achieving the positive effect of BCT. Given that the retailer and manufacturer are supply chain followers and debtors, their adoption of BCT is the key to enhancing supply chain efficiency and profits. The BCT platform can set appropriate technology-usage fees to guide participants to form the EBC structure through different paths. Meanwhile, the retailer\u2019s initial working capital can evaluate the risk-sharing degree of the supply chain, and the stable EBC selection region defined by the risk-sharing degree can be ascertained. We further find that with the trade credit insurance premium increasing, supply chain participants have become more active in adopting BCT.",

With growing application types, scalability of blockchains has emerged as a key challenge in achieving the potential of this technology. This paper attempts to outline this challenge for blockchains as follows. It highlights blockchain scalability as a composite concept which can be interpreted in various ways i.e. expanding the number of participants of the network, or enhancing capabilities of the participants (such as processing, memory, storage or an efficient consensus strategy) to minimize the scalability overhead. Further, it presents a first thorough systemic study of existing efforts to achieve blockchain scalability with respect to; (i) innovative methods and mechanisms to strengthen blockchain\u2019s capabilities with respect to scalability, (ii) approaches leveraging blockchains to achieve scalable applications, and (iii) efforts analyzing blockchain solutions with respect to scalability. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, the paper identifies contributions as well as open challenges which can help research community to advance knowledge within this domain.",

It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.",

The existing data asset management mode of electric power enterprises faces security problems such as node trustworthiness and data tampering in the process of identity mutual trust, transmission and storage, data collection and data usage. In view of this, this paper proposes a blockchain-based digital asset management framework using the decentralized, untrustworthy, and hard-to-tamper features of blockchain. In the proposed framework, we optimized security authentication mechanism, data recording and consensus process, and data storage and transmission strategy involved in blockchain data sharing applications. The framework can effectively ensure the security, integrity, operability and consistency of digital assets in the management process under the blockchain environment.",

        "Abstract": "Non-profit organization raise charity donation through different sources, and raised funds often require a clean traceability. Recently, fake charity fundraisers schemes have raised a social concern, and thus a trusted and auditable approach is necessary to manage charity organizations reputations. Blockchain-based charity (BBC) schemes are proposed with decentralization that ensure trust, transparency, and chronology among donators and beneficiaries. However, the schemes suffer from the high-end complexity of certificate generation. Motivated from this, in this paper, we propose a BBC scheme, UpHaaR, where donators, defined as charity persons (CP), and beneficiaries, defined as charity beneficiaries (CB), register in blockchain, managed for diverse fundraisers by charity organizations (CO). The scheme mitigates fake fundraisers, as the charity scheme data and fund allocations to CP are managed as ledger entries in the blockchain. To maintain the security and privacy of massive CP and CB users, the scheme proposes partial key generations through certificate-less cryptography (CLC), which mitigates expensive digital signing and eliminates certificate generation through key distribution centers. For signature aspects, the scheme proposes a lightweight certificate-less signcryption scheme (CSS) that eliminates collusion against insider attacks and reduces computational costs. The scheme is evaluated for security analysis using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and informal attack analysis, and cost evaluations. The proposed results indicate the scheme\u2019s viability against similar conventional approaches.",

It appears like everyone is racing to develop apps that run on top of the blockchain technology available today. Indeed, this is owing to the fact that it has distinct qualities and a distinctive design. However, it is not well suited to all applications of blockchain technology. Not merely altering the blockchain protocols would make it suitable, but instead redesigning its architecture is required to make it ideal for different applications. This paper describes the overview of blockchain technology thoroughly. It provides a detailed discussion on the prevalent core-oriented and client-oriented attacks on blockchain technology and the vulnerabilities exploited by them. It also presents the possible countermeasure to these attacks. Moreover, it provides insight into the creation of a better version of the blockchain that is more suitable for different types of blockchain applications.",

To do this, the paper describes a BCT solution, designed to enhance traceability, and analyses its adoption in two small firms. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach and the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), the findings have revealed that BCT improves how data is collected and has changed how firms interact with stakeholders and customers. Firms have enhanced their reputations and started targeting new domestic and international markets. Technical and economic challenges were found when persuading actors to participate in the BCT-based network.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, a Hierarchical Blockchain-based electricity market framework is proposed for peer-to-peer energy transactions within and between Microgrids in a security-constrained cluster of Microgrids. This market enhances the energy transaction mechanism, market clearing process and security of the power market. The existing blockchain based electricity markets usually check the energy availability through a transaction verification process, however, the feasibility of energy transactions between microgrids from the power system point of view is not evaluated before approving a transaction and creating a new block. In this paper, the unique structure of the market makes it possible to consider reliability security constraints of the power grid during the transaction verification process. Furthermore, the blockchain ledger summarization and microgrid\u2019s equivalent model development are other new features of this framework. To develop and verity this market framework, Java programming language is used to create the hierarchical blockchain-based algorithm, and a modified IEEE 37-bus distribution test feeder system is chosen as the case study. Numerical results will show the effectiveness of this market structure, especially, when several transactions are requested to transfer energy over some congested transmission corridors.",

        "Abstract": "The use of blockchain technology leads to improved operations and supply chain (SC) integration. Moreover, identifying and evaluating the blockchain technology application criteria in the logistics system is a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) challenge that requires taking into account the perspectives of experts with varying degrees of SC expertise. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel group decision-making method based on the best-worst method (BWM) to evaluate the criteria of implementing blockchain technology in the SC. The proposed approach provides a mechanism whereby opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are aggregated in nine steps, first. Then, weights of criteria are determined using BWM individual decision-making models. Moreover, two individual decision-making methods called nonlinear goal programming based BWM II (NGPBWM II) and linear goal programming based BWM II (LGPBWM II) are extended in this study, which can be adopted in both individual and group decision-making problems. The NGPBWM II and LGPBWM II methods can be used for both individual and group decision-making. This study proposes a novel group decision-making framework. The framework has fewer constraints than previous group BWM models and can consider different best (worst) criteria by different DMs. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated employing eight numerical examples. The results reveal the high accuracy of the NGPBWM II in all eight examples. Therefore, a combination of the proposed group decision-making method and NGPBWM II is applied in a real case to evaluate the application criteria of the blockchain technology in the automotive industry SC, which was a new application for using blockchain technology in SC.",

        "Title": "How can the dynamic game be integrated into blockchain-based distributed energy resources multi-agent transactions for decision-making?",
        "Abstract": "Distributed energy resources not only change the energy supply modes but also have great potential in energy transformation. There are some problems in distributed energy trading, such as high transaction frequency, small transaction volume, high operation cost, lack of information supervision and so on. The openness, transparency, tamper-proof and automatic execution of smart contracts of blockchain technology are consistent with the transaction demand of distributed energy. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-agent transaction model of distributed energy based on blockchain. First, the peer to peer transaction mode and transaction process are analysed. Second, a multi-agent dynamic Stackelberg game is launched. It takes distributed generation owners, energy storage companies and a grid corporation as leaders to conduct power bidding. Third, with consumers as followers, the time of use tariff bidding strategy was solved. The obtained results reveal that distributed energy resources are essential in the energy supply of carbon neutrality, which also determines the complementary relationship between a grid corporation and distributed generation owners. The two agents work together to exert effectiveness for the new power system. There is a large space for energy storage companies to improve, and consumers show a trend of off-peak power consumption.",

        "Title": "Blockchain-based identity management and access control framework for open banking ecosystem",
        "Abstract": "Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.",

        "Abstract": "In a complex and changing market environment, enterprises recognize the benefit of collaborating with their suppliers and B2B customers to minimize risks and increase the agility and efficiency of the overall supply chain. To ensure this collaboration, they are asked to share real-time data related to their activities (stock, capacity, etc.) and to collaborate with their partners to optimize operation management, to reduce costs and reach optimal service level. Therefore, they require robust and reliable IT platforms allowing partners to exchange sensitive information and guarantee transparency but also security. That explains the increasing interest among supply chain practitioners and academicians toward the blockchain technology thanks to what it promises in terms of security, transparency and automation. In this paper, we present initial steps of a study aiming to develop, test and deploy a supply chain collaboration platform using the blockchain technology. The purpose of our study is to present answers to many unsolved questions related to the ability of the blockchain technology to manage real scale supply chain data and maintain the promised advantages.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is the latest disruptive innovation. It is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency. However, the facts show that most cryptocurrencies are stuck in big issues such as scalability issues, resulting in longer transaction times. A two-layer solution was offered in previous studies to solve the scalability problem, but many issues emerged from this idea. Some of the 2 Layer proposals use the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol model, and some other studies use the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol model. In this study, the authors propose the Hybrid Lightning Protocol to solve the scalability problem of Blockchain networks by combining the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols without sharding. The author analyzes and designs the development of the Blockchain protocol based on previous research. This research is a Blockchain protocol model that can achieve a maximum throughput of around 1,668,000 transactions/second on a 2 Gbps Fiber network, which can reduce cryptocurrency volatility and shorten transaction times by solving scalability problems.",

        "Abstract": "The upcoming development in vehicle to grid network (V2G) allows for the flow of energy from battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) to grid as well as the exchange of information between them. However, during the information exchange, the EV\u2019s confidential information should be transferred from one charging station to another in a secure manner. Furthermore, the anonymity of the EV and charging station should be preserved. Despite the fact that many works on anonymous authentication and privacy preservation exist, there is an increase in computational cost in existing surveys. In this work, the new charging station authenticates the EV using blockchain technology without the involvement of a trusted entity, resulting in a reduction in computational time. Moreover, an efficient revoking mechanism is suggested to block the misbehaving charging station from the V2G network. In addition, security analysis section proves the resistant of our work against several possible well known attacks. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the work, the simulation is performed using CYGWIN platform and the results are proved to be noteworthy.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of edge computing technologies, smart healthcare significantly improves people\u2019s lives by collecting and analyzing health data in real time. However, security and privacy issues impede the wide deployment of smart healthcare systems (SHS). Most of existing solutions still have drawbacks with respect to computation efficiency and users\u2019 privacy. In this paper, a blockchain-enabled attribute-based access control scheme with hidden policies is proposed for SHS. The scheme introduces multiple authorities to avoid single point failure. Especially, the mode of online-offline encryption relieves users\u2019 online computation burden by transferring computation tasks to the idle time of users, and policy hiding protects users\u2019 sensitive information. Furthermore, fair payments are realized based on blockchain and smart contracts to support the outsourcing of decryption between users and mobile edge computing servers. Finally, the proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model, and experimental results show that it is computationally efficient and hence can be used in the edge computing environment.",

        "Title": "Blockchain and deep learning based trust management for Internet of Vehicles",
        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) works as the most advanced component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). In IoVs, vehicles are able to communicate with nearby vehicles or RoadSide Units (RSUs). Traffic safety and efficiency can be provided by collecting and uploading real-time traffic information through vehicles, as well as broadcasting information by RSUs. However, there may be malicious vehicles in the network uploading false information, which will lead to serious traffic problems. To alleviate this problem, a trust management system based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. In this system, vehicles in the network firstly collect information about their surroundings and then upload valid information to nearby RSUs. To prevent malicious vehicles from uploading false messages, this paper designs a deep learning based verification model to calculate the trustworthiness of uploaded messages, and to further obtain the credibility scores of vehicles using the calculated results, and detect malicious vehicles accordingly. Moreover, a public blockchain framework is proposed and a Proof-Of-Trust (POT) consensus algorithm is designed. Vehicles are motivated to report true and valid information, and are penalized for uploading false data under this framework. Simulation results show that this mechanism can effectively detect malicious vehicles and motivate unfamiliar vehicles to upload true and reliable information to achieve trust management in the open and dynamic vehicular network environments.",

An efficient digital network architecture is imperative to achieve secure and reliable interactions among the involved parties. From the service provider\u2019s perspective, Bby defining the mobility ownership for customers, MaaScan bring a personalized transport system to complement or even fully replace the concept of private vehicle ownership. This paper paves the initial steps to develop a distributed architecture to realize a MaaS digital network using blockchain technology. Therefore, a comprehensive blockchain-enabled MaaS platform with related industries is illustrated in this paper. To do so, first, we define crypto-tickets as means of ownership of the service and devise a straightforward smart contract to be executed in the blockchain network, which allows the customers to exchange the service ownership in a privacy-preserved manner. Then, we evaluate our blockchain-based ownership scheme\u2019s efficacy against the traditional membership plans using a simplified simulation instance in MATLAB. Finally, we discuss the blockchain potentials in personalizing the ownership of the service, congestion management, and data trading between various stakeholder of a comprehensive MaaS platform.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is popular among the technologically inclined people looking to use the computer to send and receive data while paying attention to data safety and privacy concerns. Blockchains have the ability to maintain digital data, in its transparent form as well as unaltered one, with the help of distributed computing along with cryptography and hashing techniques. Such a blockchain technology, while incorporated with Supply Chain Management (SCM), is creating a huge impact on the economy. SCM is the technique to maintain the process transformation flow from the purchase of raw materials to the production of final products and plays a vital role in economy streamlining the business activities by aligning those with customer satisfaction while keeping an eye open to the competition. The significance of blockchain in the circular economy is more because it considers not only the business parameters but also the society and the environment too. Blockchain-enabled smart contracts are employed to ensure trustworthiness and reliability in the economy. Blockchain will still be more strengthened by integrating the recent technologies such as the internet of things and machine learning in economy-related applications. An optimal and neutral finance management system will be developed by the proper blending of the aforementioned technologies. The case studies of blockchain applications in various industrial fields, at various acceptance levels, and for various organizational purposes are discussed at the end of the chapter.",

        "Abstract": "It is crucial to ensure the privacy and authenticity of patients\u2019 medical data in the medical insurance claim process, but in the current medical insurance claim process, there are some problems such as low efficiency, complex service, unreliable data and data leakage. Therefore, considering the privacy and sensitivity of patients\u2019 medical data, we can improve the current issues by employing blockchain, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof technology. In this paper, we propose a novel medical insurance claim scheme based on smart contracts, blockchain and zero-knowledge proof. Our scheme mainly involves two scenarios: medical insurance purchasing and medical insurance claiming. In the privacy-preserving transaction phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and privacy of the transactions between the patients and the insurance companies by using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and the homomorphic encryption algorithm under the Decisional Bilinear Diffie\u2013Hellman (DBDH) assumption. In the identity privacy-preserving phases of the two scenarios, we can ensure the legitimacy and the privacy of patients\u2019 identities by integrating Schnorr protocol and Fiat\u2013Shamir heuristic method. The security analysis, the computation cost and the communication cost of our scheme are given. Compared with our referred schemes, the performance evaluation shows that our scheme not only meets the requirements of the legality of the medical insurance claim, but also ensures the authenticity and privacy of the patients\u2019 medical data. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is feasible and has an acceptable time overhead.",

        "Abstract": "The future of multi-blockchain architecture depends on the emergence of new protocols that enable consensus between trustless cross-blockchain participants. However, interoperability between blockchains remains a research challenge. The existing interoperability approaches provide integration through solutions using a middleware system, making it difficult to gain confidence in the security and correctness of the process. A cross-blockchain protocol must provide a self-verifiable state proof that encodes trust in the transfer process to guarantee consensus. Inspired by the burn-address concept, we propose a Burn-to-Claim cross-blockchain protocol to exchange assets between two networks. The proposed protocol transfers assets from one blockchain system to another so that the asset is burned from the source blockchain and recreated on the destination blockchain. Our protocol makes use of digital signatures, hash-time-locks and integration mechanisms to perform cross-blockchain transactions in a distributed manner. We theoretically prove that the proposed cross-blockchain protocol transfers assets securely and correctly. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the Burn-to-Claim protocol when used in an application environment.",

Blockchain was first proposed in the year 2008 as the technology behind the now-famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Since then, blockchain technology has seen a lot of improvements and changes. Blockchain has also branched out from its digital currencies to other industries such as healthcare, governance, supply chain, and entertainment. This article focuses on how and why blockchain technology can be used in conjunction with additive manufacturing and other new technologies to keep up with the current manufacturing demands of consumers. This article zeros in on the existing problems in the manufacturing industry and how blockchain and additive manufacturing can be used to mitigate them and provides rough guidelines for future researchers or organizations looking to integrate Blockchain into their supply chain.",

        "Abstract": "Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) works as the most advanced component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). In IoVs, vehicles are able to communicate with nearby vehicles or RoadSide Units (RSUs). Traffic safety and efficiency can be provided by collecting and uploading real-time traffic information through vehicles, as well as broadcasting information by RSUs. However, there may be malicious vehicles in the network uploading false information, which will lead to serious traffic problems. To alleviate this problem, a trust management system based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. In this system, vehicles in the network firstly collect information about their surroundings and then upload valid information to nearby RSUs. To prevent malicious vehicles from uploading false messages, this paper designs a deep learning based verification model to calculate the trustworthiness of uploaded messages, and to further obtain the credibility scores of vehicles using the calculated results, and detect malicious vehicles accordingly. Moreover, a public blockchain framework is proposed and a Proof-Of-Trust (POT) consensus algorithm is designed. Vehicles are motivated to report true and valid information, and are penalized for uploading false data under this framework. Simulation results show that this mechanism can effectively detect malicious vehicles and motivate unfamiliar vehicles to upload true and reliable information to achieve trust management in the open and dynamic vehicular network environments.",

        "Abstract": "Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues arouse wide concern in both industry and academia to promote sustainable development. Listed companies assume the responsibility to submit annual reports to disclose their ESG outcomes genuinely. However, the challenge is that companies may overstate or slur their actual sustainable performance, and the entire ESG reporting process is hidden backward, thereby making the report untrustworthy. Accordingly, this paper proposes an architecture of smart ESG reporting platform leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies to enable corporate crowdsensing for environmental data and enhance the security, transparency and creditability of ESG reporting process. In addition, with the aim of motivating firms to upload massive ESG raw data of high quality, we devise an incentive mechanism that grants them crypto tokens as a reputation for sustainable performance disclosure, exposed to industry and investors for reference. The maximum tokens settlement for each environmental key performance indicator (KPI) is regarded as a cooperative game for premiums, and Shapley value is applied to fairly distribute the tokens in line with the disclosure significance scored by experienced investors. Here, we take the ESG reporting guide issued by the Hong Kong exchange (HKEX) and the practice in the Hong Kong apparel industry as the context. An experimental simulation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform architecture and approach of token allocation. This study holds the promise of providing a precedent for adopting the advanced technologies to address the greenwashing in firms and actualize intelligent and trustable ESG reporting.",

However, during the information exchange, the EV\u2019s confidential information should be transferred from one charging station to another in a secure manner. Furthermore, the anonymity of the EV and charging station should be preserved. Despite the fact that many works on anonymous authentication and privacy preservation exist, there is an increase in computational cost in existing surveys. In this work, the new charging station authenticates the EV using blockchain technology without the involvement of a trusted entity, resulting in a reduction in computational time. Moreover, an efficient revoking mechanism is suggested to block the misbehaving charging station from the V2G network. In addition, security analysis section proves the resistant of our work against several possible well known attacks. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the work, the simulation is performed using CYGWIN platform and the results are proved to be noteworthy.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is the latest disruptive innovation. It is the underlying technology of cryptocurrency. However, the facts show that most cryptocurrencies are stuck in big issues such as scalability issues, resulting in longer transaction times. A two-layer solution was offered in previous studies to solve the scalability problem, but many issues emerged from this idea. Some of the 2 Layer proposals use the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol model, and some other studies use the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol model. In this study, the authors propose the Hybrid Lightning Protocol to solve the scalability problem of Blockchain networks by combining the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols without sharding. The author analyzes and designs the development of the Blockchain protocol based on previous research. This research is a Blockchain protocol model that can achieve a maximum throughput of around 1,668,000 transactions/second on a 2 Gbps Fiber network, which can reduce cryptocurrency volatility and shorten transaction times by solving scalability problems.",

For the security of user funds in on-chain aggregation model, each oracle must pay the gas fees to transmit off-chain data to the blockchain and trigger the smart contract, but this way easily causes the network congestion. In view of this, we propose an elliptic curve threshold signature scheme for blockchain (BC-ECTSS) to overcome the above issue. In the random oracle (RO) model, we detailedly show BC-ECTSS satisfies the existential unforgeability against the adaptive chosen-message attacks; in addition, it has the anonymity and its computation cost is relatively low.",

        "Abstract": "Nowadays, one of the most common approaches for video watermarking is to use singular value decomposition in the discrete wavelet transform domain. In our prior work, we formulated a video watermarking problem to achieve the maximum peak signal to noise ratio as an optimization problem. It chooses wavelet coefficient points in key frames with minimum distortion cost. Yet the existing solution has two drawbacks (1) it requires to store a large number of coordinates depending on the watermark size; (2) it is vulnerable to video frame attacks on the video frame texture area. To avoid them, this paper proposes a blockchain-based approach. Its main concept is to choose wavelet coefficient blocks in key frames and leverage blockchain to connect all the blocks. Our experimental results show that this approach is memory efficient because it only requires to store a single key for a key frame, which is independent of the watermark size; and the overall robustness is greatly improved due to the randomness of the hash function used in the blockchain. Hence, this work had made novel and significant contributions to the field of video watermarking.",

        "Abstract": "Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain. All historical Bitcoin transactions are stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, but Bitcoin owners are generally unknown. This is the reason for Bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity, therefore it is often used for illegal transactions. Bitcoin addresses are related to Bitcoin users' identities. Some Bitcoin addresses have the potential to be analyzed due to the behavior patterns of Bitcoin transactions. However, existing Bitcoin analysis methods do not consider the fusion of new blocks' data, resulting in low efficiency of Bitcoin address analysis. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes an incremental Bitcoin address cluster method to avoid re-clustering when new block data is added. Besides, a heuristic Bitcoin address clustering algorithm is developed to improve clustering accuracy for the Bitcoin Blockchain. Experimental results show that the proposed method increases Bitcoin address cluster efficiency and accuracy.",

Thus, in the last decade, many solutions have been proposed to improve the propagation of blocks. Motivated by SRRS (social reinforcement rumor spreading), we propose a blockchain fast propagation protocol named SRRS protocol based on a non-Markovian process, where the verification and transmission of a block depend on its propagation history. The simulated experimental results show that our protocol can significantly accelerate the propagation of blocks. Compared with existing major solutions, our protocol does not change the main procedure of Bitcoin and the block data structure, which is a huge advantage for practical applications. Moreover, employing the theories of complex networks and percolation, we develop a method of theoretical analysis, which can find the optimal setting of our protocol.",

        "Abstract": "The ongoing boom in platform retailing has been accompanied by widespread counterfeiting. Blockchain technology has attracted much attention as a way to combat this practice. We consider a supply chain system consisting of one brand seller, one counterfeiter and one platform retailer and examine how blockchain adoption affects the decisions of firms in this system and the performance of the whole system. We show that the platform\u2019s use of blockchain reduces both products\u2019 selling price and increases the brand seller\u2019s demand while also increasing the counterfeiter\u2019s demand under certain conditions when a wholesale contract is adopted. Moreover, we find that blockchain technology could be an effective anticounterfeit tool but that the platform does not always use it, even if its implementation is costless. The platform is more willing to use blockchain when imitation good\u2019s quality is relatively low, and an agency contract can better incentivize the platform to deploy blockchain than a wholesale contract if the commission fee is large. Finally, consumer surplus and social welfare may decrease after the platform adopts blockchain, but the whole supply chain system can perform better through the platform\u2019s blockchain implementation if the imitation good\u2019s quality and consumers\u2019 trust in the platform are low.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology-powered applications infuse trust in the system without intermediary entities. Researchers\u2019 interest in blockchain technology has increased dramatically in recent years as a result of this distinguishing feature. However, the adoption of this novel paradigm in enterprise distributed applications is not very encouraging. To adopt a new technology in an industry, managers and technocrats have to do multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) in a fuzzy environment. The aim of this study is to propose a system model for the identification and monitoring of significant factors responsible for the slow adoption rate of blockchain technology. In this research, the MULTIMOORA method for group decision-making, a popular MCDM approach, has been further extended by integrating the information entropy weight\u2013fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model (IEW-FCEM) for an uncertain environment. The proposed method of FCEM-MULTIMOORA-FG combines the benefits of four best-in-class ranking methods, namely, the fuzzy ratio system, the fuzzy reference point method, the fuzzy full multiplicative form, and the IEW-FCEM. The idea behind integrating the IEW-FCEM with MULTIMOORA-FG is that information entropy will derive the objective weights of the criteria, thus removing the dependency upon subject matter expert experience only. An empirical study demonstrates the efficacy and practicability of the FCEM-MULTIMOORA-FG method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally straightforward with better position accuracy than previous algorithms and that its basic idea is logical and understandable, making it easier to apply in a computer system. Additionally, a comparative analysis with five more MCDM methods was executed to validate the results.",

        "Abstract": "Modeling highly accurate cyber-attacks on blockchain-based edge networks may be almost impossible in real-world circumstances due to unanticipated adversary (malicious) behavior. In this study, we propose a novel, distributed blockchain-based security architecture that today\u2019s industrial edge-enabled IoT systems may use to strengthen their defences against cyberattacks. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker on blockchain-based edge network by considering (i) hardware-level attack, (ii) network-level attack (IoT, Edge), (iii) software-level attack, wallet, smart contract, and (iv) blockchain network-level attack. We analyze the proposed attack model for sixteen different cyberattacks: False Data Injection, Sybil, DDoS, Identity Spoofing, Side-Channel, Botnet, Backdoor Trojan, Targeted Code Injection, Social Engineering, Phishing, Sinkhole, Man-in-the-middle, SQL Injection, Consensus, Eclipse, and Block Mining. Our model considers scenarios where private keys are stolen, lost, or forgotten by certain nodes. To determine the probability that a malicious attacker will be successful, we develop a simulation environment (a blockchain-based edge network with 200 total nodes, which generates 47,540 samples). We then estimate the success probability of a malicious attacker based on the blockchain resiliency (fault-tolerance) provided by the consensus algorithm, attack types, attack location, and the network size for various scenarios. Our results demonstrate that blockchain-based edge networks are more vulnerable to malicious attacks based on: (i) cyber-attack types (90.96% for Botnet and Backdoor Trojan attacks higher than for other attacks, such as DDoS, SQL Injection and Sybil); (ii) attack location (90.18% for software-level attacks higher than hardware, network, and blockchain network-level attacks); and (iii) consensus algorithm (68.85% for Byzantine fault tolerance, BFT, higher than the Proof-of-Work, PoW). The IoT network vulnerability factor, or exposure factor, of cyberattacks, depends on the strategic importance of the application to the attacker. Our results should be validated in real-world experiments with a large number of nodes.",

        "Abstract": "The targeted advertising is based on preference profiles inferred via relationships among individuals, their monitored responses to previous advertising and temporal activity over the Internet, which has raised critical privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a novel proposal for a Blockchain-based advertising platform that provides: a system for privacy preserving user profiling, privately requesting ads from the advertising system, the billing mechanisms for presented and clicked ads, the advertising system that uploads ads to the cloud according to profiling interests, various types of transactions to enable advertising operations in Blockchain-based network, and the method that allows a cloud system to privately compute the access policies for various resources (such as ads, mobile user profiles). Our main goal is to design a decentralised framework for targeted ads, which enables private delivery of ads to users whose behavioural profiles accurately match the presented ads, defined by the ad system. We implement a POC of our proposed framework i.e. a Bespoke Miner and experimentally evaluate various components of Blockchain-based in-app advertising system, implementing various critical components; such as, evaluating user profiles, implementing access policies, encryption and decryption of users\u2019 profiles. We observe that the processing delay for traversing policies of various tree sizes, the encryption/decryption time of user profiling with various key-sizes and user profiles of various interests evaluates to an acceptable amount of processing time as that of the currently implemented ad systems.",

        "Abstract": "Medical healthcare centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data for COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and training models within a single organization. This practice can be considered a weakness as it leads to several privacy and security concerns related to raw data communication. To overcome this weakness and secure raw data communication, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides a solution for collaborative data training. The proposed framework enables the coordination of multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models while preserving data privacy. Blockchain ledger technology provides decentralization of federated learning models without relying on a central server. Moreover, the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of the model to preserve privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: (i) train the local model by a novel capsule network for segmentation and classification of COVID-19 images, (ii) furthermore, we use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, (iii) finally, the model is shared over a decentralized platform through the proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing over the decentralized network. To validate our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.",

        "Abstract": "Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) supports the organizations to learn from the information (data) arriving from various connected devices, sensors, machines and other sources, and at the same time it inspires intelligence into different business operations, products, customer experiences, and people. Data poising attacks are very serious concerns because they may play a significant factor for businesses and organizations for both financial terms and damaging their reputations, when the Big data analytics on the analyzed data is itself corrupted. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we suggest a blockchain-based Artificial Intelligence(AI)/Machine Learning(ML)-enabled Big data analytics mechanism for CIoT environment. The comprehensive experimental results have been provided under two circumstances: (1) performance of the ML model under data poisoning attacks and (2) performance of the ML model without data poisoning attacks. In the first case, we show how the data poison attacks can effect the ML model when the data is on some cloud storage (i.e. not in the blockchains), whereas in the second case we show the effect when the data is in the blockchains (i.e., without data poisoning attacks). The experimental results demonstrate that we have significant gains in performance in terms of accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score when there are no data poisoning attacks on the data. Moreover, a detailed blockchain simulation has carried out to demonstrate the practical aspects of the proposed security framework.",

        "Title": "Applying blockchain-based method to smart contract classification for CPS applications",
        "Abstract": "Smart contract has been the core of blockchain systems and other blockchain-based systems since Blockchain 2.0. Various operations on blockchain are performed through the invocation and execution of smart contracts. This leads to extensive combinations between blockchain, smart contract, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) applications, and then many blockchain-based IoT or CPS applications emerge to provide multiple benefits to the economy and society. In this case, obtaining a better understanding of smart contracts will contribute to the easier operation, higher efficiency and stronger security of those blockchain-based systems and applications. Many existing researches on smart contract analysis are based on similarity calculation and smart contract classification. However, smart contract is a piece of codes with special characteristics and most of smart contracts are stored without any category labels, which leads to difficulties of smart contract classification. As the back end of a blockchain-based Decentralized Application (DApp) is one or several smart contracts, DApps with labeled categories and open source codes are applied to achieve a supervised smart contract classification. A three-phase approach is proposed to categorize DApps based on various data features. In this approach, 5,659 DApps with smart contract source codes and pre-tagged categories are first obtained based on massive collected DApps and smart contracts from Ethereum, State of the DApps and DappRadar. Then feature extraction and construction methods are designed to form multi-feature vectors that could present the major characteristics of DApps. Finally, a fused classification model consisting of KNN, XGBoost and random forests is applied to the multi-feature vectors of all DApps for performing DApp classification. The experimental results show that the method is effective. In addition, some positive correlations between feature variables and categories as well as several user behavior patterns of DApp calls are found in this paper.",

Inasmuch as the phenomenon of irregular and forced migration is the marker of the state of socio-economic systems around the world, the response to and the ways of navigating the resulting multi-scalar challenges mirror not only the efficiency of the global regulatory frameworks, but also our civility. Recognizing the potential inherent in sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT), specifically the blockchain technology and smart contracts, this paper focuses on the special case of \u201cwelcome centers\u201d that irregular migrants enter in the hope of acquiring international legal protection and thus refugee status. Since the process may be time-consuming and the living conditions undignified, this paper proposes a tool, named here \u201cresponsible wallet\u201d, aka rWallet, that bears the promise of navigating some of these challenges. rWallet derives from the recognition that in modern societies ICT should serve the purpose of improving the quality of life of all people.",

        "Abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to examine how blockchain and in general distributed. ledger technology can help to solve intellectual property challenges of today\u00b4s era of digitization. We investigate business ventures leveraging blockchain technology to manage the intellectual property life cycle, in other words how intellectual properties are created, protected, managed and monetized. Our research method is a multiple case study examining a total of 120 use cases. across all primary types of intellectual properties including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, industrial design and geographical indications. The empirical validation is based on an in-depth within-case analysis of 26 applications which were selected from the initial 120 cases based on business maturity and popularity criteria. Our goal is to understand which intellectual property challenges distributed ledger technology is trying to solve and how. We also investigate which blockchain benefits, in terms of technological security, immutability, decentralization, tokenization or disintermediation are promoted by these applications. We triangulate our case study results using a PESTEL coding framework to better understand how the blockchain ecosystem manages the intellectual property life cycle and to provide scholarly researchers and practitioners with insights on how enterprises can use distributed ledger technology to enhance the management of the intellectual property value chain. Moreover, we validate theoretical findings through the evidence collected from our multiple case study analysis, and finally we provide strategic guidance in investigating the current and anticipated challenges of blockchain entrepreneurs to drive further distributed ledger innovation.",

        "Title": "How does the retailing industry decide the best replenishment strategy by utilizing technological support through blockchain?",
        "Abstract": "Practitioners face two significant issues: product inaccuracy and transparency in supply chain management. Blockchain is a highly secure and trustworthy means of storing data. Radio frequency identification incorporation is essential if reliability is at a low level. Incorporating radio frequency identification can improve supply chain management in terms of product's visibility for the best replenishment strategy. A production and replenishment coordination via mathematical modeling is visualized through a three-echelon supply chain with a non-reliable production process, and the retailer deals with misplacement issues. The manufacturer handles the inventory flowing reversely and is responsible for proper end-of-life treatment, either repairing or remanufacturing. Repairs are sold in bulk on the secondary market, and remanufactured items are used to prevent retailers' shortages. In this model, radio frequency identification technology on the physical surface is combined with a blockchain on the cyber surface, containing all the information about the product, including its location and attributes. A comparative study is provided for the traditional supply chain with misplacement versus a blockchain-based supply chain with radio frequency identification. An analytical approach is used to arrive at the optimum policy for the practitioners, and numerical analysis illustrates the problem. Numerical experiments indicate that the technology is highly profitable for supply chain management. Radio frequency identification technology can increase profit by up to 61%. After discrepancy, holding cost is the second most sensitive parameter for the profit function. If the holding cost is higher, profit can be increased by 40% using radio frequency identification and blockchain. The negative effect of misplacement is reduced with an increasing demand rate, but the reduction rate is very slow. The choice of not adopting radio frequency identification can only be successful if demand is so high that it can reduce the effect of misplacement.",

        "Title": "A blockchain-based reputation system for trusted VANET nodes",
        "Abstract": "Vehicular network applications, such as Local Danger Warnings (LDW), have become necessary as they provide services to drivers with warnings and instructions to ensure safe driving. However, before any vehicle reacts to an alert, it is essential to verify its veracity because an incorrect warning misleads other vehicles and causes unnecessary delays and detours in traffic. On the other hand, ignoring an alert or taking too long to verify it can cause accidents. A common way to address this problem is via a reputation system, where the veracity and plausibility of an alert message are assessed based on the reputation of the vehicle that discloses it. This paper describes a decentralized reputation system based on a consortium blockchain and smart contracts called BRS4VANETs. This system analyzes the reliability of data generated by a vehicle, detects malicious behavior, and contributes to decision-making. The complete functional architecture of the system, detailing the algorithms, evaluation metrics, communication protocol, and message formats, is described and implemented. Experiments with network and traffic simulators evaluated the risk of a false message attack, the effectiveness of the system and its overheads. The assessment demonstrates the importance of reputation systems and also shows the feasibility of having a decentralized system to store and disseminate reputation information based on blockchain technologies. Finally, the results also demonstrate that BRS4VANETs can successfully detect suspicious and malicious vehicles.",

        "Abstract": "IoMT technology has many advantages in healthcare system, such as optimizing the medical service model, improving the efficiency of hospital operation and management, and improving the overall service level of the hospital. IoMT devices do not have a security authentication mechanism, and the trust between devices relies heavily on centralized third-party services. Blockchain can provide a secure interactive environment for the medical Internet of Things. However, security issues in the IoMT-Blockchain environment are also becoming increasingly prominent. Cyber-attacks targeting IoMT-Blockchain will not only compromise the security of IoT devices, but also seriously affect the security of the Internet. Therefore, how to detect abnormal traffic in the IoMT-Blockchain environment becomes particularly important. In this work, an abnormal traffic detection with deep neural network is designed for abnormal traffic detection in IoMT-Blockchain environment. First, this work proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on multi-model autoencoders. The algorithm processes the feature information in groups to reduce the complexity between traffic feature information. It builds a multi-model autoencoder to further extract fusion features between multi-model features. Second, to maximize use of traffic data information in detection network, this work proposes a multi-feature sequence anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm extracts low-level fusion features and high-level temporal features in network traffic respectively, and applies the features to anomaly detection and classification tasks by means of residual learning.",

        "Abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) supports real time analysis and provides a reliable simulation platform in the Internet of Things (IoT). The creation and application of DT hinges on amounts of data, which poses pressure on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for DT descriptions and intelligent decision-making. Federated Learning (FL) is a cutting-edge technology that enables geographically dispersed devices to collaboratively train a shared global model locally rather than relying on a data center to perform model training. Therefore, DT can benefit by combining with FL, successfully solving the \u201ddata island\u201d problem in traditional AI. However, FL still faces serious challenges, such as enduring single-point failures, suffering from poison attacks, lacking effective incentive mechanisms. Before the successful deployment of DT, we should tackle the issues caused by FL. Researchers from industry and academia have recognized the potential of introducing Blockchain Technology (BT) into FL to overcome the challenges faced by FL, where BT acting as a distributed and immutable ledger, can store data in a secure, traceable, and trusted manner. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive literature review on this topic is still missing. In this paper, we review existing works about blockchain-enabled FL and visualize their prospects with DT. To this end, we first propose evaluation requirements with respect to security, fault-tolerance, fairness, efficiency, cost-saving, profitability, and support for heterogeneity. Then, we classify existing literature according to the functionalities of BT in FL and analyze their advantages and disadvantages based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Finally, we discuss open problems in the existing literature and the future of DT supported by blockchain-enabled FL, based on which we further propose some directions for future research.",

Blockchain as a distributed technology makes possible the basic structure of a database with a combination of data blocks and hash chains. Using distributed software architecture and advanced computation, blockchain might change the method of data exchange among chain actors. Blockchain causes administration of a network in peer-to-peer and decentralized form; and influences the way of data exchange and interactions in organizations; hence, this study looks for evaluation of the impact of blockchain technology on corporate performance and governance of new firms. In the first section of the study, the research conceptual model was extracted by means of the previous studies and the hypotheses were formulated. In the second section, the relationships between the variables of the model among newly-established active business were assessed. The statistical population of the study was managers of SMEs in Iran and 397 completed questionnaires were received. Structural equation model and Smart PLS software have been used for data analysis. The research findings showed that the more the blockchain adoption in a new firm; the more direct effect it would have on the firm's performance. Similarly, corporate governance has an effect on the relationship of blockchain technology on corporate performance. Thus, managers of new firms by means of blockchain, can prepare the grounds for good corporate governance as well as the achievement of better performance.",

This article proposes an elastic batched byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol whose name is EB-BFT, which elastically changing consensus nodes participating in the consensus and scaling the number of transactions batching in the consensus based on volume of the transaction as well as the physical resources. The protocol EB-BFT first identifies low-performance nodes and suspends them from participating in consensus, so the number of consensus nodes is dynamically changed. After validate the legality of transactions sent by clients, the algorithm of dynamically scaling the number of batched transactions in consensus is proposed. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of EB-BFT in terms of throughput and latency, and it proves when the upper limit of the latency of committing transactions is set at 15 s, the dealing speed of business can reach 20000 transactions per seconds, this results proves that this protocol will make the blockchain having better performance in larger throughput and shorter latency of processing transactions, which also proves that our method can handle transactions as well as traditional centralized system.",

        "Abstract": "In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), the cross-domain identity authentication of users is very important for the development of VANET due to the large cross-domain mobility of vehicle users. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system is often used to solve the identity authentication and security trust problems faced by VANET. However, the PKI system has challenges such as too centralized Authority of Certification Authority (CA), frequent cross-domain access to certificate interactions and high authentication volume, leading to high certificate management costs, complex cross-domain authentication paths, easy privacy leakage, and overburdened networks. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain-based PKI identity management and authentication architecture that uses smart contracts to reduce the heavy burden caused by CAs directly managing the life cycle of digital certificates. On this basis, a trust chain based on smart contracts is designed to replace the traditional CA trust chain to meet the general cross-domain requirements, to effectively avoid the communication pressure caused by a mass of certificate transmissions. For the cross-domain scenario with higher privacy and security requirements the identity attribute authentication service is provided directly while protecting privacy by using the Merkle tree to anchor identity attribute data on and off the blockchain chain. Finally, the proposed scheme was comprehensively analyzed in terms of cost, time consumption and security.",

        "Abstract": "As a new distributed generation system, multi-microgrid is an important part of Energy Internet. There are a series of problems in the selection of generation resources and power trading which includes obvious concentration, fairness and low credibility. Aiming at the shortcomings of microgrid in real-time electricity trade, a multi-microgrid electricity bidding trading model based on blockchain technology is proposed. A competitive spot market with distributed \"multi-seller and multi-buyer\" is constructed to realize the integration of \"source-sale\". This paper compares the traditional trading mode with the power trading mode supported by blockchain technology. In addition, this paper establishes a blockchain-based multi-microgrid power trading model, and uses ant colony algorithm random bidding matching to achieve multi-objective optimization. Through the whole process, the unification of energy flow, information flow and currency flow are realized. Finally, the reasonable allocation of power resources and the openness and transparency of power trading are ensured.",

        "Title": "Blockchain technology for enterprise credit information sharing in supply chain finance",
        "Abstract": "Credit data barriers, such as incomplete credit records, false credit information, and low security of credit data, exist in the supply chain financial credit system, rendering it difficult to support the closure of the whole financing chain's credit system. Emerging blockchain technology can help improve credit-reporting ability through greater integrity, decentralization, transparency, security, and reliability. Aiming to address the problem of extensive credit investigation data and privacy protection, we propose a blockchain-based model to realize access control and management of the shared transaction information in the supply chain. Our model adopts a consensus mechanism to solve the problem of large credit investigation data and privacy protection of credit investigation data and realizes access control and management of the shared data chain. In our model, data are stored on the cloud server and shared with the proxy reencryption method. The model's data structure and workflow are designed to facilitate specific applications in supply chain finance. The embedded blockchain technology helps build the open shared reference architecture and establish the entire life cycle of a monitoring mechanism. The existing blockchain consensus mechanism has low security and a large resource consumption; as such, it is particularly important to design a new consensus mechanism to serve the credit investigation system. In this study, blockchain data sharing and traceability can be realized by improving the consensus mechanism, helping to improve the existing credit investigation service system. Our findings help optimize the existing supply chain financial credit system and enhance the efficiency of supply chain financing.",

However, how to design a lightweight Proof-of-Work (PoW) for the IoT without compromising security is still a problem. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight PoW for blockchain in IoT. Firstly, we present Heterogeneity Considered Trust Mechanism (HCTM) for IoT nodes, which evaluates the trust value according to capacity and quality, and makes the trust evaluation more reasonable. Then, we present Trust based Time-Constrained PoW (TBTC-PoW). We allocate reasonable time windows to the consensus nodes according to the computing resources, trust values and mining difficulty, which reduces the energy consumption and improves the security of PoW. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our method has a lower energy consumption and higher security.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid growth of modern technologies has encouraged non-profit organizations (NPOs) to harness such technologies to better serve the charity sector, especially in relation to charity donation processes. Non-profit organizations primarily rely on fundraising that may involve opaque operations, which leads to the exacerbation of fears that donations may be used for illegal purposes or not reach deserving people. The necessity of charity donations traceability system is inevitable to overcome such concerns, which have an adverse impact on doners\u2019 trust in the donation process. In this study, we propose a blockchain-based donation traceability framework intended to enable all involved parties to trace the progress of charity donations from the moment they are given by donors to the moment they reach the intended recipients. The system is built on a public-permissioned blockchain on the Ethereum platform, with every transaction being recorded as a block in the chain. These blocks of information are immutable and visible to all parties, and they also enable timely and traceable transactions. The proposed framework\u2019s effectiveness is evaluated using a hybrid qualitative approach and proves to improve the traceability of charity donations overcoming the uncertainty associated with current systems.",

        "Abstract": "Supply chains have often benefited from breakthroughs in information technology. Blockchain, in particular, is a recent technology that is promising to revolutionize the way supply chains are designed and operated. This paper proposes a framework to optimize the adoption of blockchain jointly with the design of the supply chain network. A new form of product differentiation is enabled through blockchain adoption where blockchain-certified products are sold at a premium price to a growing segment of customers. The proposed framework allows supply chain managers to monetize data which has traditionally been used to improve supply chain efficiency. The framework is evaluated using a realistic case study inspired by the global supply chain of fresh-cut flowers. The results show that by strategically using blockchain at certain locations in the supply chain network, significant cost savings are realized compared to fully deploying blockchain throughout the supply chain. These cost savings lead to increased demand, better consumer surplus, and higher supply chain profit. Furthermore, the proposed data-enabled product differentiation leads to fresher products in the market.",

However, public access to collected heterogeneous IoT urban data is more vulnerable to hackers invading intellectual property as all devices are connected to the internet. IoT security plays a vital role in the smart city. This IoT security is a real challenge as multiple goals and major inconveniences slow the rapid adaption of these smart devices. This paper presents a permissioned-based blockchain system that uses the arbiter PUF model to secure the key pairs of IoT devices using lightweight technology. A collaborative detection system is initially used to detect the DDoS on IoT devices using the machine learning-based ensemble technique, which provides a lower false-positive rate and better detection rate than the other classification technique. Next, we incorporated the blockchain system that securely shares the alarm alerts to all the nodes of the IoT network with adequately secured authentication.",

        "Abstract": "During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, many hospitals were built or renovated around the world to meet the challenges posed by the rising number of infected cases. Environmental management in the hospital life cycle is vital in preventing nosocomial infection and includes many infection control procedures. In certain urgent situations, a hospital must be completed quickly, and work process approval and supervision must therefore be accelerated. Thus, many works cannot be checked in detail. This results in a lack of work liability control and increases the difficulty of ensuring the fulfillment of key infection prevention measures. This study investigates how blockchain technology can transform the work quality inspection workflow to assist in nosocomial infection control under a fast delivery requirement. A blockchain-based life-cycle environmental management framework is proposed to track the fulfillment of crucial infection control measures in the design, construction, and operation stages of hospitals. The proposed framework allows for work quality checking after the work is completed, when some work cannot be checked on time. Illustrative use cases are selected to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed solution. This study provides new insights into applying blockchain technology to address the challenge of environmental management brought by rapid delivery requirements.",

        "Title": "Traceability vs. sustainability in supply chains: The implications of blockchain",
        "Abstract": "This research proposes a game theory model in a supply chain (SC) involving one manufacturer and one retailer. The SC works in a global market in which consumers are located worldwide and subject to traceability issues that can create distrust of the product quality. This issue can be resolved by implementing blockchain technology which provides benefits in terms of high traceability along with low transaction costs. However, blockchain negatively impacts the environment because of their high energy consumption. Therefore, in this study, we capture the trade-offs between traceability and sustainability for blockchain adoption by characterizing a game theory model. Our findings show that high levels of distrust pushes firms to avoid the implementation of blockchain. In such circumstances, blockchain is not sufficient to make consumers recognize the product quality and trust the firms\u2019 practices. In contrast, low levels of distrust can make blockchain an economically suitable technology conditioned to minimal environmental damages; otherwise, firms need to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between distrust and sustainability. Since the adoption of blockchain leads to an increase in prices and decrease of distrust, two factors determine whether to pursue this technology or not: low consumer sensitivity to price and high sensitivity to quality. In this study, we develop three specific cases where we model: 1) the direct impact of blockchain on distrust, 2) a stochastic distrust term, and 3) a Stackelberg game. Each case confirms our results and strengthens the robustness of our findings.",

        "Abstract": "The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with traditional healthcare systems has improved quality of healthcare services. However, the wearable devices and sensors used in Healthcare System (HS) continuously monitor and transmit data to the nearby devices or servers using an unsecured open channel. This connectivity between IoT devices and servers improves operational efficiency, but it also gives a lot of room for attackers to launch various cyber-attacks that can put patients under critical surveillance in jeopardy. In this article, a Blockchain-orchestrated Deep learning approach for Secure Data Transmission in IoT-enabled healthcare system hereafter referred to as \u201cBDSDT\u201d is designed. Specifically, first a novel scalable blockchain architecture is proposed to ensure data integrity and secure data transmission by leveraging Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) mechanism. Then, BDSDT integrates with the off-chain storage InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to address difficulties with data storage costs and with an Ethereum smart contract to address data security issues. The authenticated data is further used to design a deep learning architecture to detect intrusion in HS network. The latter combines Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to design an effective intrusion detection system. Experiments on two public data sources (CICIDS-2017 and ToN-IoT) reveal that the proposed BDSDT outperformed state-of-the-arts in both non-blockchain and blockchain settings and have obtained accuracy close to 99% using both datasets.",

        "Abstract": "Routing on the Internet is defined among autonomous systems (ASes) based on a weak trust model where it is assumed that ASes are honest. While this trust model strengthens the connectivity among ASes, it also results in an attack surface that can be exploited to hijack the routing paths. One such attack is known as the BGP prefix hijacking, in which a malicious AS broadcasts IP prefixes that belong to a target AS, thereby hijacking its traffic. In this paper, we propose RouteChain: a blockchain-based secure BGP routing system that counters BGP hijacking and maintains a consistent view of the Internet routing paths. Towards that, we leverage provenance assurance and tamper-proof properties of blockchains to augment trust among ASes. We group ASes based on their geographical (network) proximity and construct a bi-hierarchical blockchain model that detects false prefixes prior to their spread over the Internet. We evaluate RouteChain using three different consensus protocols and show its effectiveness by drawing a case study with the Youtube hijacking of 2008. Our results show that RouteChain can efficiently detect false prefix announcements and prevent BGP attacks over the Internet.",

        "Abstract": "The 5th generation 5G technology, also known as the 2020 telecommunications system, represents the next exciting phase of the evolution of telecommunications, with the recent successful distribution on nearly every continent. 5G is believed to bring multiple advancements such as greater transmission speeds, ultra-low latency, higher network capacity, etc. These advancements will directly support the industry-5.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) in the coming future. Today, IoT is one of the fastest-growing technologies because of its ability to deliver multiple applications across various devices. The emergence of 5G networks will be a major force for IoT development. Subsequently, Edge computing as an extension of cloud computing has emerged as a promising technology to empower 5G and IoT services due to its close vicinity to IoT Devices. However, specific challenging issues plague the integration of 5G, IoT, and Edge Computing, among which security is one of the biggest concerns. Recently, blockchain has been provided as a foundational and decentralized distributed ledger technology that can be used for solving the challenges of IoT, 5G, and Edge Computing integration. This paper proposes a trusted blockchain system for edge-based 5G networks that eliminates the limitations of integrating the Edge Computing, IoT, and 5G networks. The proposed blockchain system can efficiently identify the edge devices, authenticate the devices, and assign the addresses to the edge devices on a demand basis. Further, the proposed work also provides the secure communication among the edge devices that can protect from DDOS and Side-channel attacks.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is an unprecedented enabler and booster of business process innovation, especially in the healthcare sector. Nonetheless, its transformational potential has yet to be fully harnessed because of the challenges that digitalization has posed to Business Process Management (BPM) and the inherent complexity of the healthcare processes. Accordingly, through the ambidextrous BPM theoretical lenses, this paper investigates what are the main opportunities for Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation and which BPM capabilities may unleash them. Two exploratory case studies were conducted to probe the Blockchain-driven process redesign: a case of exploitative BPM, focusing on drug logistics, and a case of explorative BPM, focusing on integrated home care. Our findings suggest that Blockchain may enable Healthcare innovation opportunities, such as the redesign of the information flow and the development of new forms of collaboration in the health ecosystem. In addition, the most relevant BPM capabilities to pursue such innovations were identified. These results integrate the BPM research stream and enhance the understanding of Blockchain-driven healthcare process innovation.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain and the programs running on it, called smart contracts, are increasingly applied in all fields where trust and strong certifications are required. Our work focuses on industrial applications of blockchains and not on cryptocurrencies or tokens. We use frameworks to compare public and permissioned blockchains specifically suited for industrial applications. We also propose a complete solution based on Ethereum to implement a decentralized application, putting together in an original way, components and patterns already used and proven. This solution is characterized by a set of validator nodes running the blockchain using Proof-of-Authority or similar efficient consensus algorithms, by the use of an explorer enabling users to check the blockchain state, and the source code of the smart contracts running on it. From time to time, the hash digest of the last mined block is written into a public blockchain to guarantee immutability. The right to send transactions is granted by validator nodes to users by endowing them with the Ethers mined locally. Overall, the proposed approach has the same transparency and immutability as a public blockchain, largely reducing its drawbacks.",

        "Title": "A reinforcement learning model for the reliability of blockchain oracles",
        "Abstract": "Smart contracts struggle with the major limitation of operating on data that is solely residing on the blockchain network. The need of recruiting third parties, known as oracles, to assist smart contracts has been recognized with the emergence of blockchain technology. Oracles could be deviant and commit ill-intentioned behaviors, or be selfish and hide their actual available resources to gain optimal profit. Current research proposals employ oracles as trusted entities with no robust assessment mechanism, which entails a risk of turning them into centralized points of failure. The need for an effective method to select the most economical and rewarding oracles that are self-interested and act independently is somehow neglected. Thus, this paper proposes a Bayesian Bandit Learning Oracles Reliability (BLOR) mechanism to identify trustless and cost-efficient oracles. Within BLOR, we learn the behavior of oracles by formulating a Bayesian cost-dependent reputation model and utilize reinforcement learning (knowledge gradient algorithm) to guide the learning process. BLOR enables all the blockchain validators to verify the obtained results while running the algorithm at the same time by dealing with the randomness issue within the limited blockchain structure. We implement and experiment with BLOR using Python and the Solidity language on Ethereum. BLOR is benchmarked against several models where it proved to be highly efficient in selecting the most reliable and economical oracles with a fair balance.",

        "Abstract": "With the development of new energy, the ancillary service demand of power grid is increasing. The published literature focuses on building a blockchain ancillary service market to ensure the safety and efficiency of ancillary service transactions. However, due to the high threshold and poor scalability, the existing blockchain market is hard to meet the demand of the response rate of ancillary services. Therefore, this paper proposes an energy storage capacity competition-based demand response method in blockchain ancillary service market. Firstly, a new market structure is proposed, which uses the Proof of Capacity (POC) as the consensus mechanism. The structure uses POC to realize the competition among users\u2019 energy storage capacity. Secondly, the demand response process of ancillary service market is designed. During the transaction processes, the probability of users participating in the transaction is changed according to the users\u2019 storage capacity. Dealing with different demands, the market chooses the user with the largest capacity or the combination of users to respond. The simulation shows that, compared with the traditional ancillary service market, the capacity competition-based market demand response rate is increased by 20%, the time to fulling all users\u2019 capacity in the market is reduced by 2 h, and the call rate of user\u2019s capacity is increased by 10%.",

The involvement of major corporations in product development and blockchain-integrated closed-loop recycling has resulted in several successful green chemical approaches toward circular plastic economy projects. Government policies and legislations are progressively supporting plastic redesigning for improving the plastic circular economy. Nevertheless, a systematic approach is required in addressing blockchain technology and plastic redesigning to effectively leverage circular economy initiatives.",

        "Abstract": "Conventional Cooperative spectrum sensing techniques either suffer from single point of failure attack or lack in providing incentives to users which makes them incompatible for Wireless Service Provider (WSP). We propose a dynamic spectrum access framework for WSP which gives prominence to automated sensing and sharing with the use of blockchain. In this system, the opportunity of spectrum access is first examined by sensor nodes and the access right is then allocated to the users when their transactions to WSP are authenticated in a decentralized manner. Apart from using blockchain as a reliable platform for automatic enforcement of spectrum sensing, we propose a novel mechanism for securing our network from the threats designed primarily for Cognitive Radio Networks. In addition to this, our proposed approach enhances the scalability of blockchain networks by using the sidechains for storing data and checkpointing it onto main chain after periodic intervals of time. Extensive simulations in Octave indicate superior performance offered by our proposed model.",

        "Abstract": "With increasing uncertainties in the global economy, companies are facing fierce competition. Blockchain has the potential to enhance companies\u2019 competitiveness by streamlining processes, improving productivity and reducing costs. It is meaningful to study whether and when companies would adopt blockchain and under what conditions. We develop a game theoretic model to analyse the introduction of blockchain to companies from a big customer with bargaining power. In this study, ship operators need to decide their optimal adoption time when facing a request from a big shipper to adopt blockchain with a threat of substitution policy from the shipper. An algorithm is developed to obtain the numerical solutions of ship operators\u2019 optimal adoption time. Our analysis suggests that 1) the substitution policy only matters to small companies and is only necessary under fixed pricing model; 2) a threshold applies for substitution ratio and cut-off time to effectively induce small companies to adopt blockchain early; 3) blockchain developers should consider mixed pricing model instead of fixed pricing model for faster and wider blockchain adoption; 4) blockchain initiators should focus more on improving the technology\u2019s cost-effectiveness rather than rely heavily on externalities like substitution policies to promote blockchain adoption.",

        "Abstract": "Data dissemination of safety messages in smart transportation allows vehicles to broadcast safety-related information about their surroundings to other vehicles within their proximity for early warnings of endangering events. Safety can only be achieved if the data transmitted are reliable. However, this may violate the privacy of a vehicle. At the same time, malicious or defective vehicles should be held accountable when misbehavior occurs. Utilizing blockchain technology, we propose a secure data dissemination scheme for smart transportation that solves the conflicting security requirements of reliability, privacy and accountability simultaneously, which provides a desirable level of security through its decentralized system. The analysis evaluation and simulation experiments signify our proposed scheme achieves security and performance efficiency, robust against adversarial attacks and practical for real world deployment.",

        "Title": "T2L: A traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics",
        "Abstract": "Traceability and trustiness are two critical issues in the logistics sector. Blockchain provides a potential way for logistics tracking systems due to its traits of tamper resistance. However, it is non-trivial to apply blockchain on logistics because of firstly, the binding relationship between virtue data and physical location cannot be guaranteed so that frauds may exist. Secondly, it is neither practical to upload complete data on the blockchain due to the limited storage resources nor convincing to trust the digest of the data. This paper proposes a traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics T2L to provide an efficient solution to the mentioned problems. Specifically, the authenticated geocoding data from telecom operators\u2019 base stations are adopted to ensure the location credibility of the data before being uploaded to the blockchain for the purpose of reliable traceability of the logistics. Moreover, we propose a scheme based on Zero Knowledge Proof of Retrievability (ZK BLS-PoR) to ensure the trustiness of the data digest and the proofs to the blockchain. Any user in the system can check the data completeness by verifying the proofs instead of downloading and examining the whole data based on the proposed ZK BLS- PoR scheme, which can provide solid theoretical verification. In all, the proposed T2L framework is a traceable and trustable logistics system with a high level of security.",

        "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to realize distributed machine learning on heterogeneous clients without exposing their private data. However, there is the risk of single point failure with FL because it relies on a central server to gather the model updates from clients, moreover, malicious behaviors of some clients may lead to low-quality or even poisoned global models. Blockchain as a revolutionary distributed ledger technology can alleviate the above problems to significantly enhance the security and scalability of FL systems. Therefore, this article presents a general framework of Blockchain-based Federated Learning (BFL) system with detailed description of its key technologies and operation steps. We then review and compare the most recent representative BFL applications. And we outlook some key challenges and opportunities of the future BFL system in terms of security, cost, and scalability. Finally, we propose PoS-BFL in IoT scenarios with malicious devices. The validator voting mechanism and role switching mechanism in PoS-BFL ensure the stakes of legitimate nodes, and effectively reduce the impact of malicious nodes on the accuracy of the system model. And the experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PoS-BFL can achieve 86% accuracy, which is much higher than vanilla FL and pFedMe, and PoS-BFL is robust to some extent by adjusting the ratio of workers, validators and miners.",

        "Abstract": "The increased density of the urban population and frequent transportation movement has lead to parking issues in these areas. Many efforts have been made to efficiently utilize the existing parking facilities. Most of these solutions target the large-scale private and public parking facilities; however, the individual parking facilities are not much explored and exploited for reducing the parking issues. In the last few years, the Online-to-Offline (O2O) model has witnessed huge attention from the research community due to its versatile applications in many domains. The main objective of the O2O model is to create service awareness online, allowing potential users to review different offers and then visit local physical places for purchasing. The security of the users\u2019 data has always been considered a crucial factor in any public sharing platform. The blockchain model has been regarded as a solid security platform for many public sharing platforms. This work designed a blockchain framework with a novel data verification and role-based Access control method for securing the parking service data. Several experiments are performed using the sawtooth blockchain tool to investigate the performance of the proposed blockchain framework against the baseline approach concerning latency, meantime testing (MTT), throughput, transaction sending rate (TPS), and average response time (ART). The obtained results confirm that the proposed approach is scalable and feasible for smart parking and other IoT-based applications.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain as the trust\u2010enabling technology has supported and transformed cyber-physical systems in recent years. Therefore, many organizations have adopted blockchain-based technology to develop industrial software-product-service systems. However, the implementation of blockchain at the organizational levels can be related with several technical, organizational, legal, financial, and environmental challenges (intra-organizational and inter-organizational). Analysis of these challenges will play a significant role in organizational performance. This study has investigated an extensive list of challenges of software blockchain-based implementation in cyber-physical systems. The proposed comprehensive model is applied to the software development industry in Iran as a case study. Based on the experts\u2019 opinions, challenge identification was conducted via the two-phase fuzzy Delphi method for medium and large organizations. Extensive quantitative and qualitative challenges are evaluated via the efficient best-worst fuzzy method. Obtained results indicate that smart contracts vulnerabilities and deterministic execution of the technical challenge group have the most critical importance and governance of the legal challenge group has the least vital importance. It is mentionable that most technical challenges have higher priority than other considered challenges.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain is a viable solution to provide data integrity for the enormous volume of 5G IoT social data, while we need to break through the throughput bottleneck of blockchain. Sharding is a promising technology to solve the problem of low throughput in blockchains. However, cross-shard communication hinders the effective improvement of blockchain throughput. Therefore, it is critical to reasonably allocate transactions to different shards to improve blockchain throughput. Existing research on blockchain sharding mainly focuses on shards formation, configuration, and consensus, while ignoring the negative impact of cross-shard communication on blockchain throughput. Aiming to maximize the throughput of transaction processing, we study how to allocate blockchain transactions to shards in this paper. We propose an Associated Transaction assignment algorithm based on Closest Fit (ATCF). ATCF classifies associated transactions into transaction groups which are then assigned to different shards in the non-ascending order of transaction group sizes periodically. Within each epoch, ATCF tries to select a shard that can handle all the transactions for each transaction group. If there are multiple such shards, ATCF selects the shard with the remaining processing capacity closest to the number of transactions in the transaction group. When no such shard exists, ATCF chooses the shard with the largest remaining processing capacity for the transaction group. The transaction groups that cannot be completely processed within the current epoch will be allocated in the subsequent epochs. We prove that ATCF is a 2-approximation algorithm for the associated transaction assignment problem. Simulation results show that ATCF can effectively improve the blockchain throughput and reduce the number of cross-shard transactions.",

Therefore, it is necessary to formulate an incentive compatible demand response mechanism to take the needs of demand-side users and the grid company into account. Based on the current bidding demand response program, a two-stage transaction mechanism of demand response quota based on blockchain is proposed in this work. Firstly, a two-stage transaction mechanism for demand response quota considering day-ahead bidding transaction and intra-day double auction transaction is designed. Then, the smart contract is introduced to realize the proposed blockchain-based two-stage transaction mechanism of demand response quota, and all the smart contract functions involved in each business link are customized. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed transaction mechanism of demand response quota is illustrated by the simulation results on the platform of Remix IDE.",

        "Abstract": "Research on blockchains addresses multiple issues, with one being automated creation of smart contracts. Developing smart contract methods is more difficult than mainstream software development as the underlying blockchain infrastructure poses additional complexity. We report on a new approach to develop smart contracts with the objective to automate the process to increase developer efficiency and reduce risks of errors introduced by software developers. To support industry adoption, we use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) modeling to describe an application while targeting applications in the trade vertical. We describe a system that transforms a BPMN model into a multi-modal model that combines Discrete Event (DE) modeling for concurrency with Hierarchical State Machines (HSMs) to represent application functionality. Then, further transformations are used to transform the DE-HSM model into methods in smart contracts. The system lets the modeler decide which of the independent patterns should be transformed into methods of a separate smart contract that is deployed on a sidechain for the purpose of (i) reducing processing costs and/or (ii) providing privacy so that other participants in the smart contract do not have visibility into processing of the pattern. We also briefly describe a proof-of-concept tool we built to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "Medical healthcare centers are envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data for COVID-19 patients using artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and training models within a single organization. This practice can be considered a weakness as it leads to several privacy and security concerns related to raw data communication. To overcome this weakness and secure raw data communication, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides a solution for collaborative data training. The proposed framework enables the coordination of multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models while preserving data privacy. Blockchain ledger technology provides decentralization of federated learning models without relying on a central server. Moreover, the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of the model to preserve privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: (i) train the local model by a novel capsule network for segmentation and classification of COVID-19 images, (ii) furthermore, we use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, (iii) finally, the model is shared over a decentralized platform through the proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing over the decentralized network. To validate our proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments and the results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.",

        "Abstract": "Social product design (SPD) is a new kind of product design pattern emerged under the background of sharing economic trends and fast developing online communication technologies. Due to the participation of large numbers of socialized designers (SDs), SPD pattern has the capability of utilizing socialized design resources to increase the design power of design companies with relatively lower costs. However, the SDs have the characteristics of self-driven, self-organized, unaffiliated, distributed and discontinuous participation, and stranger collaboration. These characteristics lead to the problems of low collaboration efficiency, low controllability, and low mutual trust during SPD process. Consequently these problems could limit the industrial application of SPD in relatively complicated and intellectual property issues involved design projects. Addressing these problems, a Blockchain and modified Best-worst algorithm enhanced Blackboard model is established. The Blackboard model with customized components can improve the collaboration efficiency and orderliness among SDs. The Blockchain can realize reliable recording of the discontinuous participation of SDs in SPD process. On this basis, a modified Best-Worst algorithm is established to support the estimation of the contribution degrees of SDs during SPD process. Combined together, the model can improve the operability of SPD application. A 3D printer concept design project was used as case study, and the result shows that the model can improve the operability of SPD pattern in relatively complicated and intellectual property issues involved design projects compared with ordinary crowdsourcing or opensourcing design models, but its higher operating cost may limit its application only for high valued design projects.",

        "Title": "Improving blockchain performance in clinical trials using intelligent optimal transaction traffic control mechanism in smart healthcare applications",
        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology has revolutionized the ways of processing and storing data in terms of reliability and security. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in transferring the processing hurdle from the client\u2013server to a decentralized and secured platform. Blockchain is deemed to be an efficient technology in a forthcoming era that would beneficiate multifarious industries. An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.",

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-and backscatter-aided Internet of Things (IoT) system. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using an RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables an IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under dynamics of the primary channel, uncertainty of the IoT devices, and unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) a transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.",

        "Abstract": "As a key component of smart grid (SG), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) realizes two-way communication between users and power companies. Considering that AMI involves a large number of important data, which are related to the measurement of users\u2019 electricity bills and the decision-making of power suppliers. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of AMI data security and privacy to avoid economic losses caused by data leakage and tampering. Aiming at the problems of trust and single point of failure in the existing protection schemes, this paper proposes an AMI security framework based on blockchain. By combining the characteristics of blockchain such as decentration, tamper proof, traceability, the architecture of AMI data management system is reshaped. The technologies of peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithm and smart contract of blockchain are used to solve the problems of secure storage, transmission and application of AMI data. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the feasibility of introducing blockchain technology into AMI is verified. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and reliable, which provides a strong guarantee for AMI data security and privacy protection.",

A CD model based on extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) mechanism as well as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) construction, enable end-users to create efficient schemes for the continuous verification and validation of the execution of applications in edge\u2013fog\u2013cloud infrastructures. This scheme also verifies and validates established execution sequences and the integrity of digital assets. CV model converts ETL and DAG into business model, smart contracts in a private blockchain for the automatic and transparent registration of transactions performed by each application in workflows/pipelines created by CD model without altering applications nor edge\u2013fog\u2013cloud workflows. This model ensures that IoT dataflows delivers verifiable information for organizations to conduct critical decision-making processes with certainty. A containerized parallelism model solves portability issues and reduces/compensates the overhead produced by CD/CV operations. We developed and implemented a prototype to create CD/CV schemes, which were evaluated in a case study where user mobility information is used to identify interest points, patterns, and maps. The experimental evaluation revealed the efficiency of CD/CV to register the transactions performed in IoT dataflows through edge\u2013fog\u2013cloud in a private blockchain network in comparison with state-of-art solutions.",

        "Abstract": "Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users\u2019 daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data\u2019s privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.",

It overcomes the challenges faced by the existing BFT protocol in three aspects: single-point failure, huge total message sizes, and limited by the slowest nodes. The proposed protocol secretly selects block proposers and uses threshold signature as a multi-round voting mechanism to confirm the validity of the proposed block. We adopt transmission pipelining to improve the network utilization while optimizing the gossip communication scheme to reduce the total message sizes. Finally, our protocol guarantees the security and liveness of the system. Experimental results show that, compared with other related BFT protocols (e.g., PBFT), TSBFT can effectively solve these three challenges. In addition, our experiments also show how the different optimization ingredients of TSBFT contribute to its performance and scalability. The results show that compared with the traditional BFT protocol, it can scale from dozens of nodes to hundreds of nodes.",

        "Title": "Proposing a new LSGDM framework based on BWM with hesitant fuzzy information for prioritizing blockchain adoption barriers in supply chain",
        "Abstract": "Due to the vast advantages of Blockchain technology, especially transparency of information and the ability to track transactions, this technology has been considered in several areas, including supply chain management (SCM). However, due to the emergence of this technology, numerous barriers and limitations have hindered its use. Due to the special conditions of developing countries (such as Iran), there is still a need for independent research to localize these barriers in these countries. On the other hand, most of the research has focused more on identifying barriers and less on prioritizing them. Examining the specific features of the Blockchain technology field shows that there is a need to provide a decision-making framework based on large-scale group decision-making methods (LSGDM), which, in addition to simultaneously paying attention to the advantages of previous approaches (including the participation of different groups of stakeholders; the consensus reaching process (CRP) as well as the uncertainty and doubt of the stakeholders in the evaluations), can increase the applicability of the method by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons. Therefore, while identifying and localizing the list of barriers in Iran, the LSGDM method along with the proposed consensus framework can be used to aggregate the opinions between the experts in a network and create a relative consensus between them. The use of hesitant fuzzy (HF) sets has made it possible to model the uncertainty and hesitancy in the opinions of experts. Also, using the Best-Worst method (BWM) instead of the pairwise comparison approach between all criteria, has reduced the number of pairwise comparisons and provided other advantages such as reduced inconsistency and higher reliability. The results of applying this framework in Iran showed that lack of awareness and customer orientation, scalability and lack of management participation and support are the main barriers to the implementation of the blockchain for SCM in this developing country. The results can help decision makers and policy makers in this area to plan more accurately.",

        "Abstract": "Digital Twin (DT) supports real time analysis and provides a reliable simulation platform in the Internet of Things (IoT). The creation and application of DT hinges on amounts of data, which poses pressure on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for DT descriptions and intelligent decision-making. Federated Learning (FL) is a cutting-edge technology that enables geographically dispersed devices to collaboratively train a shared global model locally rather than relying on a data center to perform model training. Therefore, DT can benefit by combining with FL, successfully solving the \u201ddata island\u201d problem in traditional AI. However, FL still faces serious challenges, such as enduring single-point failures, suffering from poison attacks, lacking effective incentive mechanisms. Before the successful deployment of DT, we should tackle the issues caused by FL. Researchers from industry and academia have recognized the potential of introducing Blockchain Technology (BT) into FL to overcome the challenges faced by FL, where BT acting as a distributed and immutable ledger, can store data in a secure, traceable, and trusted manner. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive literature review on this topic is still missing. In this paper, we review existing works about blockchain-enabled FL and visualize their prospects with DT. To this end, we first propose evaluation requirements with respect to security, fault-tolerance, fairness, efficiency, cost-saving, profitability, and support for heterogeneity. Then, we classify existing literature according to the functionalities of BT in FL and analyze their advantages and disadvantages based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Finally, we discuss open problems in the existing literature and the future of DT supported by blockchain-enabled FL, based on which we further propose some directions for future research.",

        "Abstract": "IoMT technology has many advantages in healthcare system, such as optimizing the medical service model, improving the efficiency of hospital operation and management, and improving the overall service level of the hospital. IoMT devices do not have a security authentication mechanism, and the trust between devices relies heavily on centralized third-party services. Blockchain can provide a secure interactive environment for the medical Internet of Things. However, security issues in the IoMT-Blockchain environment are also becoming increasingly prominent. Cyber-attacks targeting IoMT-Blockchain will not only compromise the security of IoT devices, but also seriously affect the security of the Internet. Therefore, how to detect abnormal traffic in the IoMT-Blockchain environment becomes particularly important. In this work, an abnormal traffic detection with deep neural network is designed for abnormal traffic detection in IoMT-Blockchain environment. First, this work proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on multi-model autoencoders. The algorithm processes the feature information in groups to reduce the complexity between traffic feature information. It builds a multi-model autoencoder to further extract fusion features between multi-model features. Second, to maximize use of traffic data information in detection network, this work proposes a multi-feature sequence anomaly detection algorithm. The algorithm extracts low-level fusion features and high-level temporal features in network traffic respectively, and applies the features to anomaly detection and classification tasks by means of residual learning.",

        "Abstract": "Network marketing is a trading technique that provides companies with the opportunity to increase sales. With the increasing number of Internet-based purchases, several threats are increasingly observed in this field, such as use privacy violations, company owner (CO) fraud, the changing of sold products' information, and the scalability of selling networks. This study presents the concept of a blockchain-based market called ACR-MLM that functions based on the multi-level marketing (MLM) model, through which registered users receive anonymous and confidential rewards for their own and their subgroups' sales. Applying a public blockchain as the ACR-MLM framework's infrastructure solves existing problems in MLM-based markets, such as CO fraud (against the government or its users), user privacy violations (obtaining their real names or subgroup users), and scalability (when vast numbers of users have been registered). To provide confidentiality and scalability to the ACR-MLM framework, hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) was applied with a functional encryption (FE) scheme. Finally, the security of ACR-MLM is analyzed using the random oracle (RO) model and then evaluated.",

        "Abstract": "The global trend of credentialism as well as increased mobility in studies and work bring new requirements regarding the verification of academic qualifications. So far, traditional nostrification processes face challenges related to high process cycle times, elevated fees, and fraud incidents. In the higher education domain, blockchain-based approaches have emerged to revitalize the verification of academic qualifications, but they mostly rely on closed concepts offering their facility to a limited circle of entities. As a result, the verification of degrees is not publicly available to any third party. Moreover, in most cases, a concise process-aware approach describing the intended functionality with appropriate models is missing; this absence raises ambiguity and trust issues in the implemented application. This paper presents the design and early implementation of the VerDe (Verified Degrees) platform; a proposed blockchain-based application for registration and verification of academic qualifications. The novelty of the approach presented in this paper is the implementation of VerDe as a decentralized application utilizing Business Process Model & Notation (BPMN). This work demonstrates that usage of BPMN constructs provides an efficient method in addressing blockchain usability and complexity issues and facilitates the design and implementation of blockchain-based applications. The benefits of deploying VerDe in conjunction with BPMN are an efficient and transparent facility able to handle mobility consequences, detect fraud, and overcome administrative barriers by offering the verification capability to any third-party, and employing a custom-made token that emulates the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).",

        "Abstract": "Data sharing services based on massive IoT data have been widely used in various fields such as health monitoring and image recognition, providing users with more reliable, efficient, and flexible data services and significantly improving the user service quality. With the popularization of IoT applications, the usage rate of IoT data is getting higher and higher. Due to the dangerous network environment, the security of IoT data faces challenges. On the one hand, attacks such as data tampering can lead to the failure of IoT tasks, and on the other hand, the intrusion of malicious users can lead to the collapse of the entire IoT network. In recent years, many protection schemes used for IoT data security have been proposed. However, security flaws still exist in these schemes. Therefore, to solve the data security and identity security issues in the IoT data sharing process, in this paper, we propose a TEE-and-Blockchain-supported IoT data sharing architecture(TEBDS), which combines on-chain and off-chain methods to meet the security requirements of the IoT data sharing framework. Therein, the consortium blockchain realizes the protection of on-chain IoT data and the access control of IoT users. An Intel SGX-based Distributed Storage System (SDSS) is proposed to secure off-chain data. Besides, an incentive mechanism is developed to facilitate the whole system. Security analysis shows that TEBDS meets the requirements of data security and identity security. Experimental results show that TEBDS has better performance than the centralized method SPDS.",

        "Abstract": "Modern healthcare systems are complex and regularly share sensitive data among multiple stakeholders, such as doctors, patients, and pharmacists. Patients\u2019 data has increased and requires safe methods for its management. Research works related to blockchain, such as MIT MedRec, have strived to draft trustworthy and immutable systems to share data. However, blockchain may be challenging in healthcare scenarios due to issues about privacy and control of data sharing destinations. This paper presents a protocol for tracking shared medical data, which includes images, and controlling the medical data access by multiple conflicting stakeholders. Several efforts rely on blockchain for healthcare, but just a few are concerned about malicious data leakage in blockchain-based healthcare systems. We implement a token mechanism stored in DICOM files and managed by Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain. Our findings and evaluations revealed low chances of a hash collision, such as employing a fitting-resistance birthday attack. Although our solution was devised for healthcare, it can inspire and be easily ported to other blockchain-based application scenarios, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Besu for business networks.",

This paper analyzes trends and highlights the potential benefits of blockchain deployment in IoT and healthcare. According to the literature, blockchain technology is mostly utilized for data management operations in healthcare and IoT, specifically to improve data security, which includes data integrity, access control, and privacy preservation. In both areas, six distinct types of data security preservation strategies are applied. Additionally, publications highlight how blockchain and IoT, including health IoT, can be used in an integrative way. Three integration mechanisms were seen to accomplish this goal. These solutions range from fully integrating blockchain into data exchanges between IoT devices to using it solely for metadata storage. The most frequently covered area of IoT is a smart city, where blockchain is utilized to improve real-time data sharing, and electricity trading, and so on. Additionally, it is learned that, despite the numerous benefits of blockchain in healthcare, authors typically use it for drug supply chain management and data management purposes in order to avoid counterfeiting and empower patients with regard to their data, respectively.",

        "Title": "Synchronizing DDoS defense at network edge with P4, SDN, and Blockchain",
        "Abstract": "Botnet-originated DDoS attacks continue to plague the internet and disrupt services for legitimate users. While various proposals have been presented in the last two decades, the botnet still has advantages over the defenders, because botnets have orchestrated processes to launch disruptive attacks. On the other hand, the defenders use manual methods, siloed tools, and lack orchestration among different organizations. These unorchestrated efforts slow down the attack response and extend the lifespan of botnet attacks. This article presents shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN, an inter-organization collaborative defense framework using P4, SDN, and Blockchain, which extends our earlier research on microVNF, a solution of Edge security for SIP-enabled IoT devices with P4. Besides mitigating DDoS attacks, microVNF also produces attack fingerprints called Indicator of Compromise (IOC) records. ShieldSDN and shieldCHAIN distribute these IOCs to other organizations so that they can create their own packet filters. Effectively, shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN synchronize packet filters for different organizations to mitigate against the same botnet strain. Four experiments were performed successfully to validate the functionalities of shieldSDN and shieldCHAIN. The scope for the first experiment was intra-company, while the second, third, and fourth experiments were inter-company. In the first experiment, shieldSDN extracted IOCs from the source switch and installed these as packet filters on other switches within the same organization (in the U.S.). In the second experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the publishing organization (in the U.S.) shared IOCs by posting them to the Blockchain. In the third experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations (in Singapore & the U.K.) retrieved these IOCs from Blockchain. Finally, in the last experiment, the shieldCHAIN in the subscriber organizations installed the retrieved IOCs as packet filters; that are identical to those in the originating organization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that uses the P4 switch, SDN controller, and Blockchain together for this use case. As SDN and Blockchain gain acceptance, this framework empowers community members to collaborate and defend against botnet DDoS attacks.",

        "Title": "Efficient sharing of privacy-preserving sensing data on consortium blockchain via group key agreement",
        "Abstract": "Due to the self-organizing and distributed nature of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), valuable data in sensor networks faces security and privacy risks. A blockchain-based approach enables secure and convenient sharing of sensor information among different users. Compared to public and private blockchains, consortium blockchain is widely used across different industries and use cases in WSN due to its auditability and high transaction rate. However, sensing data sharing via consortium blockchain raises the privacy issue. Therefore, the data from the sensor node is encrypted by the key (named\n) shared by the sensor node and the sink node and then sent to the blockchain network to not reveal the privacy of the sensing data. Since the infrastructure in large-scale WSN is usually owned and managed by multiple organizations, encrypted sensing data needs to be authorized by these multiple organizations for computation. Organizations requesting privacy-preserving data are referred to as data sharers. Distributing the\nto each data sharer requires separate encryption of the key using the data sharer\u2019s public key. The sink node needs to be online when each data sharer asks for the\n, and one encryption of the\nfor each data sharer consumes precious resources. This work proposes GSChain for efficient privacy-preserving sensing data sharing on consortium blockchain. Multiple data sharers resort to asymmetric group key agreement protocol to maintain a shared group encryption key and their respective group decryption keys, enabling efficient\nretrieval from the consortium blockchain. The\nis encrypted only once by the group encryption key and stored on the consortium blockchain along with the privacy-preserving sensing data. Our scheme improves the efficiency of privacy-preserving data sharing among multiple data sharers while reducing the online demand for sink nodes. Although the data-sharing group should remain stable for a long time, we design the group key update scheme. We also discuss how old and new data sharers access different ranges of privacy-preserving sensing data as the data-sharing group changes. We build a complete implementation of GSChain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and conduct a comprehensive set of experimental studies. Our experimental results demonstrate that GSChain improves the privacy-preserving sensing data sharing efficiency with tolerable time and storage overhead. In addition, the time overhead caused by the recovery of the GSChain system is tolerable when the membership of the data-sharing group changes.",

        "Abstract": "Smart contracts allow application developers to automate business processes through a decentralized computation architecture. Contemporary blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric offer support for smart contracts through consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or other types of transaction validation and ordering services. This article exploits smart contracts in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain platforms. In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multi-stakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms, such as Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu.",

        "Title": "On-chain behavior prediction Machine Learning model for blockchain-based crowdsourcing",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of behavior prediction for task allocation in blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. Centralized crowdsourcing frameworks complement workers\u2019 reputations with predicted behavior, through Machine Learning (ML) models, to improve the task allocation performance and maintain worker engagement. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks allocate tasks to workers using reputation solely, which neglects the impact of a task\u2019s context on the worker\u2019s behavior. Our contribution is an on-chain behavior prediction ML model for task allocation on top of a proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework. The ML model, hosted on blockchain, reflects a worker\u2019s unique behavior for a task given its context. The proposed ML model is: (1) trained off-chain since it has lower monetary cost compared to on-chain training, and (2) deployed on-chain as a smart contract to enable transparent predictions. The task allocation mechanism in the proposed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework considers workers\u2019 predicted behavior and a Quality of Information (QoI) metric that includes distance to the task, completion time, and workers\u2019 reputation. The evaluation conducted confirms that the proposed task allocation mechanism, implemented using Solidity, outperforms the benchmark in terms of percentage of allocation, workers\u2019 QoI, and reputation change.",

        "Title": "Privacy-preserving Blockchain-assisted private-parking scheme with efficient matching",
        "Abstract": "Due to the drastic increase in the number of vehicles, searching for available parking spots has become a major problem for drivers, especially in crowded and big cities. Thus, a smart parking system is crucial not only to facilitate drivers\u2019 ability to find parking spaces, but also to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and vehicles\u2019 gas consumption. A growing number of public parking lots have been constructed to provide parking spots for drivers. Meanwhile, homeowners and landowners leave their private spaces that can be utilized and rented for other drivers seeking parking spaces. This paper proposes a decentralized smart private-parking scheme built on top of Blockchain. Blockchain is used to run and organize the developed parking scheme to help drivers find nearby parking spots owned by private homeowners and landowners. However, parking owners and drivers should send requests/offers that include the location/time information of spots and/or desired locations to park at. This information can be used to track daily live activities for both drivers and parking owners such as whether a parking owner is at home or not, drivers\u2019 destinations, etc. To preserve privacy, in the proposed scheme, drivers/parking owners submit their requests/offers in an encrypted format, and the Blockchain can find feasible matches among the encrypted requests and offers without the need to get access to original sensitive information. In addition, an overlapping and partitioning technique is used to generate the requests/offers to increase matching results by finding more nearby drivers to park and thus maximizing parking owners\u2019 profits. Finally, the proposed scheme has been implemented on Hyperledger Blockchain and extensive evaluations have been conducted using different simulation scenarios. The results indicate that the scheme is efficient in terms of scalability and throughput under different case scenarios. Also, security and privacy analysis are conducted to demonstrate that the scheme can run the services securely while ensuring drivers/parking owners\u2019 privacy.",

        "Title": "Modeling and analysis of port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain",
        "Abstract": "With the development of international trade, the core position of port transportation progressively emerges. However, most current port supply chain systems adopt a centralized data management mode. Each operator in the supply chain has its platform and data set, which is prone to form information islands and can create trust issues, resulting in the inefficient overall operation of the supply chain. To improve the efficiency of the supply chain, a port supply chain system based on Fabric blockchain (Fabric-PSChain) is designed and implemented. In the proposed system, four smart contracts are developed by taking advantage of the blockchain\u2019s decentralized, tamper-free, distributed consensus, combined with the Role-Based Access Control Policy (RBACP), realizing the functions of access control policy formulation, enterprise list query, cargo order uploading, and order query. At the same time, the regulator node is added to the Fabric-PSchain system to enhance the credibility and security of data and meet regulatory compliance requirements. Experimental results show that the Fabric-PSChain system has vital confidentiality and data sharing that can speed up the operation of the port supply chain business and has significant application value for the shipping logistics industry.",

        "Abstract": "With the progress of the times and the development of electronic products, more and more images are captured and stored on multiple cloud servers, which are more likely to exhibit dishonesty because of interdependence rather than semi-honesty and thus how to achieve search over multiple clouds becomes intractable. Moreover, most of the existing research works on content-based image retrieval so far do not consider dishonest clouds and thereby do not support multi-cloud retrieval. On the one hand, a central search server is generally introduced for the convenience of retrieval in the system with multiple cloud servers. However, the central search server may return false or incomplete search results for possible commercial profit, which reduces the retrieval accuracy. On the other hand, cloud servers may destroy the image integrity by deleting or tampering images to save computing and bandwidth resources, resulting in the loss of important information for the image owner and incorrect decryption of the image for the user. In order to address these two problems, we propose a blockchain-assisted privacy-protected similarity image retrieval in the multiple cloud environment, which can not only ensure the accuracy of the retrieval results, but also can verify the integrity of images. The performance of this scheme is evaluated on a real-world dataset, and the results show the high retrieval precision and efficiency of this scheme.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain technology can improve supply chain transparency to solve many problems in agricultural supply chains, such as lack of social responsibility and poor environmental performance. However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is \u201cTechnical Characteristics\u201d, and the top three sub-enablers are: \u201cblockchain smart contract\u201d, \u201cblockchain security,\u201d and \u201ctracking product components\u201d, respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT. As far as we know, this paper is one of the first studies to evaluate blockchain's enablers for SSCT, especially in the context of African emerging economies.",

We also propose a complete solution based on Ethereum to implement a decentralized application, putting together in an original way, components and patterns already used and proven. This solution is characterized by a set of validator nodes running the blockchain using Proof-of-Authority or similar efficient consensus algorithms, by the use of an explorer enabling users to check the blockchain state, and the source code of the smart contracts running on it. From time to time, the hash digest of the last mined block is written into a public blockchain to guarantee immutability. The right to send transactions is granted by validator nodes to users by endowing them with the Ethers mined locally. Overall, the proposed approach has the same transparency and immutability as a public blockchain, largely reducing its drawbacks.",

        "Abstract": "Heart disease is one of the leading causes for death in men and women across the globe. Several characteristics that can be monitored to predict the heart disease in the earlier stage are blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level and body weight. The technology is revolutionizing the existing healthcare infrastructure. With the inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT), now we can monitor patients remotely, store their data, and process it for further analysis. However, the need is to propose new and advanced secured algorithms for fast processing and efficient detection of events. In this article, a machine learning based Sine Cosine Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour (SCA_WKNN) algorithm is proposed for the heart disease prediction that learns from the data being stored in blockchain. Since the data stored in the blockchain are tamper resistant, it acts as an authentic source for learning data and also as a secure storage environment for patient information. The performance of proposed SCA_WKNN is assessed in comparison with other algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and root mean square error. Our analysis indicates that SCA_WKNN achieves 4.59% and 15.61% maximum accuracy than W K-NN and K-NN, respectively. Also, blockchain-based storage is compared with peer-to-peer storage in terms of latency and throughput. The blockchain-based decentralized storage achieves 25.03% maximum throughput than peer-to-peer storage.",

        "Title": "A blockchain-based model with an incentive mechanism for cross-border logistics supervision and data sharing in modular construction",
        "Abstract": "Sustainability in cross-border logistics requires issues such as fragmented management to be addressed. Particular challenges arise in cross-border logistics in modular construction (CLMC) because supervision is inefficient, primarily due to continued use of paper-based documentation. Researchers have developed digital platforms that integrate accurate prefabricated module location information but their centralized operation creates information security issues such as tampering. Blockchain technology can overcome this limitation but relies on user participation. This study, therefore, develops a blockchain-based supervision (BBS) model with incentives for application in CLMC. The BBS model is developed using a design science research approach to enhance supervision of CLMC and motivate users to share data promptly, and then a prototype system is developed and evaluated in a CLMC case. The results show that the system brings a positive change in product accountability (df = 8, t = 0.6601, p = 0.528) compared with current paper-based recording process (df = 8, t = 0.0035, p = 0.997), and a positive change in data traceability (df = 8, t = 1.468, p = 0.180) compared with existing process (df = 8, t = 0.042, p = 0.967). In addition, this study obtains higher scores (552) than others in evaluating the incentive mechanisms. The security analysis is also discussed through data immutability, non-repudiation, authentication, and authorization. The \ufb01ndings of this study pave the way for a tamper-proof, incentive-enabled supervision mechanism in modular construction.",

        "Title": "Enhancing blockchain-based filtration mechanism via IPFS for collaborative intrusion detection in IoT networks",
        "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) has become more important for setting up a smart environment, e.g., smart home. It is a network of connected devices, which can provide many benefits such as automating and controlling the tasks on a daily basis without human intervention. While due to the dispersed structure, IoT networks are vulnerable to various attacks, e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). To protect such environment, building a suitable collaborative intrusion detection network (CIDN) is essential by enabling the exchange of required data among nodes. In addition, deploying a packet filtration mechanism with CIDN is necessary to reduce unwanted events and traffic. However, how to safeguard the integrity of exchanged information is a challenge, because a malicious internal node can manipulate and deliver untruthful data. Motivated by the blockchain technology, in this work, we develop a blockchain-based filtration mechanism with CIDN to help protect the security of IoT networks by refining unexpected events. In addition, we leverage IPFS technology to host and share information like blacklist. In the evaluation, we examine the filter performance with three real datasets, a simulated environment and a practical environment, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our filter compared with similar studies.",

        "Abstract": "The 5G communication technology and edge computing jointly form 5G Edge and eliminate the constraints of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) devices to facilitate several real-time healthcare services, including patient monitoring and diagnoses from anywhere. Nevertheless, the 5G Edge platform introduces risks of internal attacks to the data integrity and privacy of IoMT data. Hence, end users cannot trust data retrieved from the 5G Edge. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving search result certification framework for IoMT data on 5G and edge computing-assisted blockchain networks. The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, the proposed framework introduces a blockchain platform involving 5G Edge servers to ensure tamperproof data storage. In addition, an encrypted data storage model and a symmetric-key cryptography-based privacy-preserving search mechanism are developed for the 5G Edge blockchain. Second, the framework leverages an efficient multi-signature scheme to design a tamperproof search result certification mechanism for IoMT data on the blockchain of 5G Edge. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.",

        "Abstract": "Critical effects of global climate change urgently call for socio-technical transitions towards more efficient, flexible and cleaner energy systems. However, adequate regulatory frameworks and policy incentives are lagging behind. This paper focuses on the governance dynamics shaping technology-enabled transitions towards distributed energy systems. The purpose of this review is to assess the potential role of blockchain technology in enhancing the governance of sociotechnical energy transitions. For this, the paper reviews: (1) the governance arrangements shaping distributed energy transitions, (2) the emergence of blockchain-based solutions in the energy sector (focusing on P2P energy trading platforms) and, (3) the role of the blockchain in overcoming the governance limitations of distributed energy transitions. The study addresses emerging but interrelated niches of academic study from an integral conceptualization and synthesis of the literature. Rather than extensively covering these fields of research, the purpose is to connect these areas of academic knowledge and expand the theoretical understanding stemming from this convergence. The findings show the potential of blockchain-based governance to overcome institutional barriers related to trust-building and enhanced coordination for community-based energy transitions.",

        "Abstract": "As more and more mobile devices and IoT terminals are connected to the Internet, a huge amount of spatio-temporal data is generated. In order to cope with the pressure of storing and computing massive amounts of data locally and to share data to fully utilize its value, data owners usually store data in cloud servers. However, the data owner will lose physical control of big spatio-temporal data while the big spatio-temporal data is stored on the cloud, and it will be at the risk of being tampered with and deleted. Therefore, this paper designs a blockchain-based secure storage mechanism, BSMD, which adopts an on-chain and off-chain cooperative storage model to alleviate the shortage of blockchain storage capacity. The updatable subvector commitment designed in this paper is used to construct the on-chain and off-chain secure authentication protocol which ensures the consistency of on-chain and off-chain data and makes the protocol have the capability of batch processing. Finally, the correctness and security of the proposed protocol are proved, and the performance of the protocol is analyzed.",

As members exercise their voting rights, a fault-tolerant record accumulates on the blockchain that can be analyzed to diagnose and intercept potential threats to the governing body. To date, there has not been a systematic study of on-chain governance with respect to voting. In this paper, we provide an analysis of blockchain governance through a case study of the first cryptocurrency to adopt on-chain voting, Dash. Our analysis introduces the key characteristics of blockchain governance, steps through a data-driven exploration of Dash's on-chain voting system, and highlights exploitable attack vectors and vulnerabilities for the subversion of Dash's on-chain voting system via a novel network analysis methodology. We then conclude with guidelines for other organizations looking to implement similar blockchain governance solutions while maintaining integrity in their operations.",

        "Title": "T2L: A traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics",
        "Abstract": "Traceability and trustiness are two critical issues in the logistics sector. Blockchain provides a potential way for logistics tracking systems due to its traits of tamper resistance. However, it is non-trivial to apply blockchain on logistics because of firstly, the binding relationship between virtue data and physical location cannot be guaranteed so that frauds may exist. Secondly, it is neither practical to upload complete data on the blockchain due to the limited storage resources nor convincing to trust the digest of the data. This paper proposes a traceable and trustable consortium blockchain for logistics T2L to provide an efficient solution to the mentioned problems. Specifically, the authenticated geocoding data from telecom operators\u2019 base stations are adopted to ensure the location credibility of the data before being uploaded to the blockchain for the purpose of reliable traceability of the logistics. Moreover, we propose a scheme based on Zero Knowledge Proof of Retrievability (ZK BLS-PoR) to ensure the trustiness of the data digest and the proofs to the blockchain. Any user in the system can check the data completeness by verifying the proofs instead of downloading and examining the whole data based on the proposed ZK BLS- PoR scheme, which can provide solid theoretical verification. In all, the proposed T2L framework is a traceable and trustable logistics system with a high level of security.",

        "Abstract": "A primary objective of blockchain technology is to address information security and efficiency issues related to existing information sharing systems. For the sharing of health records, little is known about the application of blockchain in management information systems. There are strict regulations for sharing health information due to insecure systems and privacy concerns. To significantly and effectively improve medical diagnosis, it is beneficial to have efficient, reliable, and accurate accessibility to a patient's full medical history. Due to concerns with the security of health systems and privacy concerns, medical histories are not always accessible to healthcare providers. To help increase accessibility options, this research proposes a blockchain-based model that facilitates sharing medical records in a manner that is beneficial to both healthcare providers and patients. Social exchange theory provides the theoretical support for the conceptual model presented. Experimental findings based on 151 participants revealed that the blockchain technology can provide a secure information system and increase patient motivation to share medical records. To show the applicability of the proposed use of blockchain from a practical managerial perspective, we show feasibility by developing an Android software application.",

        "Abstract": "Rational miners in the blockchain may admit the validity of search results directly to conserve calculation overhead without executing the validation. Such phenomenon is known as the Verifier's Dilemma that the search results of the blockchain-based searchable encryption scheme would be claimed to have been verified but devoid of valid verification. Besides, the top-k query technique utilized by most existing searchable encryption schemes fails to filter the search results from the user demands during retrieval, which results in massive ineffective access lists with high complexity. Aiming at the two problems, we present a blockchain-based multi-keyword ranked searchable encryption scheme and design a fair payment protocol for multi-user scenarios. Our scheme may achieve public verifiability and user fairness by leveraging the TrueBit network, while the data owner (DO) can withdraw search privileges from the authorized data user (DU). Also, we extend the searchable encryption scheme based on inverted index to multi-DO/multi-DU scenarios, and the HashMap index is used to diminish the response time and space complexity. Moreover, the proposed scheme supports the update of index keywords and files dynamically. To enhance retrieval accuracy, we modify the information divergence algorithm in machine learning and utilize the monotonically weighted aggregation function, which improves retrieval accuracy to around 97%. Finally, Security analysis illustrates correctness and resilience against typical attacks to verify the robustness and utility of the proposed scheme.",

        "Abstract": "Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and anonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system, blockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the technology\u2019s adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions and blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits scalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing solutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization, limiting the technology\u2019s original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a distributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for blockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high scalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains from broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains where all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of IoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks which in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers: (i) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced along with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks, from the source to the destination, and (ii) verification layer where a set of randomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The performance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing overhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet overhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the processing overhead remains scale-independent.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and reliable data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It aims to secure data sharing among AVs. We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, blockchain holds promise to impact a wide range of application areas, but it still suffers from technical challenges such as security and scalability. The increase in the number of transactions puts blockchains under data storage pressure. The emergence of cross-chain technologies connects different blockchains and relieves the data storage pressure. However, the existing research generally focuses on the technical realization of cross chain, lacking in-depth research on consistency issues like data integrity verification of cross-chain interaction. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cross-chain data integrity verification scheme (DCIV) from the point of view of governing the chain by chain. We adopt supervision chain to audit the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction. We preprocess the off-chain original data in the form of Merkle tree. Before cross-chain interaction, we process the data with KZG polynomial commitment. During the auditing period, the supervision chain generates a challenge and verifies the integrity of cross-chain data. In particular, we add audit digests into the structure of transactions in blockchain to reduce the storage burden during auditing. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that DCIV can verify the integrity of data in cross-chain interaction, achieving secure and accurate cross-chain data sharing.",

        "Abstract": "The blockchain is tremendous technology for securing data transmission over a decentralized cloud environment. A PHR can offer easy data exchange and storage. However, unauthorised individuals may steal sensitive users' data from cloud devices, leading to significant privacy leakage risks. The main problem is that the non-authentication policy leads to key leakages due to unauthorised entries through intruders. To resolve this problem, we propose Blockchain-Based Decentralized Security (BCDS) using Crypto-Proof of Stake (CPoS) for securing sensitive Personal health care records. First, to process the security, the lattice construction phase is used based on blockchain decentralized. The Random shuffle block padding is intended to rehash the block to score with padding bits to block-level encryption. Then the sensitive terms are marginalized by threshold labels being highly encrypted by Optimized Starvation Point Link Encryption (OSPLE) to protect the data. By integrating Master Node Key Aggregation Policy (MNKAP) to verify the contact proof of staking authentication to the peer end to authenticate the security. The Delegate proof of stack provides higher security to protect the sensitive terms by accessing PHR records transactions to improve the integrity proofing to the admittance of the key to deliver the data. The key signature verification then validates the key for authentication to decrypt the protected data. This proves a higher security protocol and authentication principle than any other method as well as security proofing.",

        "Title": "Behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation in agrifood supply chain management: A thematic analysis",
        "Abstract": "Despite its perceived utility, several companies and managers continue to hold reservations about blockchain implementation in supply chain management. To elucidate the causes, we examine the behavioural and organisational antecedents that influence the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management. To do this, we undertake thematic analysis on blockchain-related agri-food business news and expert opinions from the Ovid database's Agricola section. Four themes are central to our model: organisational adoption strategies, technical advantages, environmental obstacles, and implementation intention. Using these themes, we build a thematic map and derive three propositions about the role of behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation intention in supply chains, thus substantiating Behavioural Reasoning Theory (BRT) and Technology Organisation and Environment (TOE) theory's core arguments. Our findings elucidate novel factors influencing blockchain adoption in supply chains. More specifically, we show that managers who consider the technological benefits associated with blockchain capacity are able to provide stakeholders with new opportunities and embrace adoption strategies such as product launch and partnership formation while also considering environmental and contextual barriers such as market fragmentation, scarcity of research, and regulatory restrictions.",

        "Abstract": "Could we rely on credit swap hedging as a substitute for insurer blockchain technology involvement? This paper is to develop a two-stage contingent claim model to answer the question. We have three main results. First, blockchain helps the policyholder protection when blockchain involvement is relatively large-scale, helps the insurer's survival probability when blockchain involvement is relatively small-scale and helps enable greater efficiency. Second, credit swap hedging adversely affects policyholder protection and increases a higher likelihood of insurer survival. The life insurance company could regard credit swap hedging as a strategic substitute for blockchain involvement. Third, capital regulation makes the insurer more prone to blockchain involvement, thereby accelerating the transformation of the insurance system.",

        "Abstract": "The traditional system designed by incorporating the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) suffers from important issues such as centralization of information, single source of trust, and fails to provide a trusted data-auditing solution due to the involvement of Third Party Auditor (TPA). This article proposes a novel solution by leveraging the concept of blockchain and Distributed Data Storage Service (DDSS) system to mitigate the issues mentioned above. In our model, the sensor nodes are accountable for their activity because the blockchain permanently records the logs of sensor nodes. The proposed solution provides the decentralized authentication of sensor nodes and the information stored in the fully distributed system. Furthermore, a decentralized data-auditing scheme without involving the TPA is also suggested, which finally benefits the user in terms of bandwidth and money. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is done using the Scyther simulator tool, which indicates that the protocol is safe and can protect against the relevant attacks with 100% accuracy. We have estimated the proposed scheme\u2019s time complexity and computational efficiencies and compared them with the existing one. The computation and communication overhead of the proposed method is reduced by 22.143% and 12.5% compared with the Khalid et al. (2020) scheme. Lastly, the ethereum platform simulates our solution, confirming that less than USD 2 is required to execute the proposed solution.",

This paper analyzes the influence of the initial willingness of game players, the cost and utilization degree of blockchain technology, government subsidies, the price reduction coefficient of users, and the loss of photovoltaic-storage being wholesaled on the results of evolutionary equilibrium. The results show the cooperation between photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers will become one of the trends of photovoltaic development in the future, and users will greatly enhance the utilization degree of photovoltaic and realize the value co-creation of the three parties. The decrease of blockchain technology cost, the increase of blockchain utilization, the increase of government subsidies, the increase of user price reduction coefficient, the decrease of photovoltaic-storage loss coefficient of being wholesaled and so on encourage the increase of cooperation of photovoltaic power generators and energy storage providers, and users' behavior of using photovoltaic. These results can provide some reference for the development of photovoltaic and energy storage industry.",

        "Abstract": "Recent improvements in consumers' awareness of product traceability have revealed the disadvantages of traditional supply chain traceability systems. Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products. The results of this study provide guidance for supply chain members\u2019 market practices.",

        "Title": "Sustainable development of green reverse logistics based on blockchain",
        "Abstract": "With the continuous convenience of life, logistics has become an indispensable existence in life. Logistics application, such as the southern banana transportation to the country, major cities can buy all the year round; Xinjiang ha honey melon, Ningxia white orchid melon, northeast rice, Tianjin small station rice are not seasonal supply market. However, with the increasing frequency of logistics activities, its damage to natural resources and ecological environment is becoming more and more serious. The waste produced in logistics is increasing day by day, which puts great pressure on the environment. Such as steel slag, industrial waste water, waste computers, waste batteries and other kinds of inorganic waste. Goods return is the most important activity in the green reverse logistics. Because reverse logistics is a kind of logistics activity including product return, logistics replacement, item reuse, waste disposal, reprocessing, repair and remanufacturing and other processes. Returns are the key part of it. In order to ensure the goods, return to the manufacturer and get good disposal, it is necessary to record the whole process information of the goods from the factory to the customer. Blockchain is a chain composed of one block after another. Each block holds certain information in each block, which are connected into chains in their respective chronological order. Based on this, this paper proposes a sustainable development strategy of green reverse logistics based on blockchain. In the strategy research, based on the characteristics of decentralization, non-tampering and high information security of blockchain technology(BT), this paper proposes a commodity traceability scheme based on blockchain. In this traceability scheme, this paper uses the structure of Merkel tree to design a license chain to store detailed commodity traceability information, and stores the Merkel tree root node of the license chain block in the public chain, forming a \u201cdouble chain\u201d structure of commodity traceability system. The simulation analysis shows that the traceability information stored in the license chain can use the high security of the public chain to ensure the security of information. Compared with the traditional blockchain, the double chain structure designed in the article, has a larger throughput, which can trace the source of the product to the manufacturer, ensure that the goods can be returned to the manufacturer for further processing, reduce the generation of waste in the logistics, and provide a guarantee for promoting the sustainable development of green reverse logistics.",

        "Title": "HBFL: A hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework for collaborative IoT intrusion detection",
        "Abstract": "The continuous strengthening of the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems is vital due to the increasing number of interconnected devices and the volume of sensitive data shared. Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy-preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model\u2019s detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.",

        "Title": "RZee: Cryptographic and statistical model for adversary detection and filtration to preserve blockchain privacy",
        "Abstract": "Preserving anonymity and confidentiality of transactions has become crucial with widespread of the blockchain technology. Despite of the increased efforts for retaining privacy in blockchain networks, invasion attacks are still surfacing. Most of these attacks do not come from outsiders, but from the resident adversarial nodes. Existence of these insider adversaries lead to damaging of an organization\u2019s internal network system and information leakage. Consequently, transaction anonymity and confidentiality are compromised. Hence, adversary detection and filtration play a vital role in protecting networks against unforeseen privacy and security threats. Therefore, in this paper, we propose RZee, a cryptographic and statistical privacy preserving model for adversary detection and filtering in blockchain networks. Firstly, RZee exploits zero-knowledge proofs to cryptographically secure the data. Secondly, based on certain identified conditions, RZee captures node behavior and blacklists malicious nodes to restrict those from injecting harmful data into the chain or viewing transactions as they propagate across the network. This adds an additional layer of protecting transactions from unauthorized and malicious intervention. The proposed framework is evaluated based on various privacy attributes as identified by literature. For this evaluation, 4 different types of experiments have been conducted. Further, the comparison of privacy perseverance of RZee with existing benchmark privacy-preserving frameworks is also done. The results depict that performance and privacy preservation in RZee exceeds the rest with an attribute score of 6.774 and a gain margin of 46.5%.",

        "Abstract": "Digital collection and maintenance of evidence corresponding to an accident is of utmost relevance as vehicles become connected and part of Internet of things ecosystem. A conceptual evidence management framework is proposed examining the future of accident investigation forensics in the era of connected vehicles. The framework discusses how evidence generated from vehicles involved in incident along with supporting evidence from nearby vehicles CCTVs and road users can be collected and managed over blockchain using smart contracts in a vehicle to everything connected environment. The management of evidence over blockchain serves as an immutable and auditable means to investigate and settle cases post an accident among the stakeholders. Dynamic access control over evidence data and reports based on location of incident and vehicle involved is implemented with the help of smart contracts. The cost of deploying and carrying out transactions using the smart contracts is evaluated over both public and private Ethereum blockchain. Mechanism and cost involved in storing evidence on chain versus off chain using Inter Planetary File System in most optimised manner saving memory and execution cost is compared and presented. The smart contract codes are deployed on Rinkeby test network and can be accessed using address mentioned.",
